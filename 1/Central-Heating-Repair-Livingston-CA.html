Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
