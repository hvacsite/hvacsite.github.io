<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
