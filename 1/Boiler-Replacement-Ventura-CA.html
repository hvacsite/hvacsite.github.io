<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
