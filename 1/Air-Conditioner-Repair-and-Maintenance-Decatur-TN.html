<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Decatur TN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
