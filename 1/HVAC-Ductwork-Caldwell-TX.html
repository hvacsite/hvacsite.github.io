However, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
