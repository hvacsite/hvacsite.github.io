<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
