<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be germs buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house.
