<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
