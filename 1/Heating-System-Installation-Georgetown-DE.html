(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
