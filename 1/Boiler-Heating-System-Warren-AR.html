<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed concerns. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more trusted than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and available source of energy.<p>
