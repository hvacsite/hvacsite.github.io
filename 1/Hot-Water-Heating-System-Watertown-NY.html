<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
