<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
