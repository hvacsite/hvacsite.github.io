<p>The installation was quick, professional and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize quickly people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss information that creates a job effectively done. I really extremely suggest the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
