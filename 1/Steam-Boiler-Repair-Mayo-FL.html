<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
