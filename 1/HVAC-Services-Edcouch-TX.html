<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
