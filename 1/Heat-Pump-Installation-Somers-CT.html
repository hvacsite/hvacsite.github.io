<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
