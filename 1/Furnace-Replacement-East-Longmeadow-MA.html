<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., office devices; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
