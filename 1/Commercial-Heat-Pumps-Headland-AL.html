<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
