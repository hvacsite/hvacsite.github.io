<h3>Gas Central Heating in Oxford OH 45056</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
