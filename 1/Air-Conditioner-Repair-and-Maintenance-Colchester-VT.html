<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Colchester VT 05446</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
