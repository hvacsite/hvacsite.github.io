<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
