Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
