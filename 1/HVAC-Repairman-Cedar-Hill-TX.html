<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
