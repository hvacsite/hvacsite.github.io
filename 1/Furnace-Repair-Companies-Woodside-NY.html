<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system.

Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However much of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than designs made 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older.

<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home.

<p>Given that heating & cooling work might also need repairing or installing plumbing to provide oil or natural gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor may also be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumber on call.

When getting a quote, make sure to ask not only if a company is certified, but likewise what type of license it holds.<p>
