<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
