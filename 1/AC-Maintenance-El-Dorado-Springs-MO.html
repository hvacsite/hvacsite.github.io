<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
