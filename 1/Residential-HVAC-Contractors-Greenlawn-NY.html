<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
