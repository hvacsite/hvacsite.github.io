<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the damaging results of lead. Children might have greater exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
