<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Ligonier PA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
