Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the very core of the furnace. Replacing one means dismantling most of the furnace, replacing the part, and reassembling the furnace. The number of hours it takes frequently causes the repair to be more expensive than the furnace was or a new one would be. If you replace a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, think about anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin due to the fact that they have the very best heat exchanger service warranties in the market on their leading heating systems.<p>
