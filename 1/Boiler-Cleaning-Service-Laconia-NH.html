<p>Homeowners might also presume that since a radiant floor heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their home's value. No proof exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely affects residential or commercial property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Publication.
