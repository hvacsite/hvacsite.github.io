<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures.
