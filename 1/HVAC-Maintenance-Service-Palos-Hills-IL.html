<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
