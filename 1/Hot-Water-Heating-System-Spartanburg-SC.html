<h3>HVAC Maintenance Plans in Spartanburg SC 29301</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are generally not really efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
