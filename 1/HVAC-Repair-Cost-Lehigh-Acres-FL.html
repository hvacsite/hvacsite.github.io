<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has actually determined structure products, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, however much of the danger also originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily.
