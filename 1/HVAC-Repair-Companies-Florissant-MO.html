<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
