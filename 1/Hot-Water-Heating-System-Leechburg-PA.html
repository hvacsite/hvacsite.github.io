<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
