The companies were not made aware they became part of a study, and the scientists did not manage for time invested or methods used. The EPA study recommended and managed techniques utilized on a smaller sized variety of homes.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the concern and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
