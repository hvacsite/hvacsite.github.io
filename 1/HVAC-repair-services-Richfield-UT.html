<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your vehicle.

During high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
