<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important impacts.
