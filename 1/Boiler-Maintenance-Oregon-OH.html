<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to reduce the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heater. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels reach and drop listed below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heat pump.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
