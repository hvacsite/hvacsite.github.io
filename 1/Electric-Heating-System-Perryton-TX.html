<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure.

Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners.

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
