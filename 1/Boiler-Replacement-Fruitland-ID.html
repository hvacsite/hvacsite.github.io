<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
