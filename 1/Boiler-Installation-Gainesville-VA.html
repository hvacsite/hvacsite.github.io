<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gas, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise develop particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>CARB is actively involved in the development of green building requirements and indoor air quality guidelines. CARB also controls indoor air cleaners so that consumers can be assured of their security.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.
