<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd problem that sometimes shows up. It is very essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do see your furnace acting strangely.

<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
