<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>

Additionally, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water alongside its primary function of supplying area heating. This means that cost savings are still realized during the cooler duration. In fact, a desuperheater reduces winter water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>
