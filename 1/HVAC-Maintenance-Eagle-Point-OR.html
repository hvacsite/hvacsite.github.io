<p>Due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
