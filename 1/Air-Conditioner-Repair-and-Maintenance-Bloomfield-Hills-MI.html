<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
