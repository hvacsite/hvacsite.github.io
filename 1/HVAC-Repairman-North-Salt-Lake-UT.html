<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
