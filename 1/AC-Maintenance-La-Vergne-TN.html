<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health signs is an efficient, properly developed and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system identifies the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is added to the work environment atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its toxins are either tired to the outside or re-circulated throughout the structure.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
