<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
