<p>Many people underestimate the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is normally imagined as the black smoke discharged from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the home. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside your home, and over half that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might grovel twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>

<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the introduction of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures should not be undertaken until these problems have been remedied.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
