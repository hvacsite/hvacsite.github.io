<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a home can be heated in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide constant and trusted heating & cooling.<p>

Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and normally are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
