<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
