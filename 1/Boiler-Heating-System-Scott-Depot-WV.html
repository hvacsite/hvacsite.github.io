<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
