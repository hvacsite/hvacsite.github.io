<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
