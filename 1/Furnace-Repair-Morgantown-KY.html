Pushed wood items produced indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
