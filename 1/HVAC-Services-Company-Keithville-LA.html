<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
