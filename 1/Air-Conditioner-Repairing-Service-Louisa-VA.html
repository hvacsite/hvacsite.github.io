<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs.

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes.
