<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores. The main risk of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic homes is the capability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that. Most of the time they were at first interested in remotely monitoring some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't up until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to provide a healthier, safer building environment-- and to head off the negative repercussions associated with indoor air pollutants.<p>
