<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

<p>Normally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
