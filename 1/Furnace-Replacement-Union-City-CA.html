<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
