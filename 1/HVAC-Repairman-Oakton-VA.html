<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should also be required to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.)

Extra weatherization measures need to not be undertaken till these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioners are known for promoting guarantees and uses a basic 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER score in energy performance would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install.

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
