<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
