<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Derwood</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A trained technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
