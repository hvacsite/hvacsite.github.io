<p>Today's home radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a restroom flooring or be set up across the entire sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
