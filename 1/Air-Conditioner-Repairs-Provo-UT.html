The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
