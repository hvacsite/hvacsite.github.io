<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to consider.

Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated.

For that reason, this may not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
