The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
