<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace should also be checked regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire threat. Disconnected fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system as well. Soot can accumulate in burners and broken heat exchanger s can have an impact on the system's effectiveness also.

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost.
