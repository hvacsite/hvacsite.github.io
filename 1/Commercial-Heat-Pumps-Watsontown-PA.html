<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Homes can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family houses since many of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and home products, are similar.

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
