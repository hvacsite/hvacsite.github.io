<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
