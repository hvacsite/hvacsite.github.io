<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
