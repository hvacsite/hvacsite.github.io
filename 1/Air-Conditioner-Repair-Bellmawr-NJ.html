<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
