<p>If you have a big house, a home with high ceilings, a home with numerous windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floors instead of the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.

These modifications could actually build up and perhaps lower your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>In addition, homeowners have a variety of alternatives to choose from in powering a flooring heater. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As numerous homeowners are all too aware, legacy furnace systems are typically limited to working on a single energy source, such as heating oil.
