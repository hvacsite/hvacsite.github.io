<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes.

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Oakdale CT</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
