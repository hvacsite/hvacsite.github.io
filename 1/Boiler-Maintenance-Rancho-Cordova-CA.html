<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
