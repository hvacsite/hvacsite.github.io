<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
