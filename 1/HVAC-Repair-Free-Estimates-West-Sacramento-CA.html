<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
