<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can also generate air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
