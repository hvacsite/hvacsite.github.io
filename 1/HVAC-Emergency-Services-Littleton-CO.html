<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
