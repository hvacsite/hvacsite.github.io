<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior.

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Davis CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in colder climates were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the walls, floors and ceilings heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furnishings and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
