<p>There are a great deal of advantages to utilizing a radiant heating system over a conventional forced air heating unit.

A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
