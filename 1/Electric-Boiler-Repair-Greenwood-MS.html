<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
