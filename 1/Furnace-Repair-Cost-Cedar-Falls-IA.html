<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for bids. While both were valuable and useful, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat.

Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
