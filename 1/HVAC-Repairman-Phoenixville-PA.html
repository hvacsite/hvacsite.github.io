Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

A voided service warranty will not do you any great should the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the get-go and hire a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
