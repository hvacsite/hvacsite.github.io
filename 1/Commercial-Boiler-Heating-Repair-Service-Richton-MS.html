<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
