<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants or perhaps transferring susceptible residents.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more dependable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>
