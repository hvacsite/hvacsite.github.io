<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
