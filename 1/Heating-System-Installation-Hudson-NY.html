<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
