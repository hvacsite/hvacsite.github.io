<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Hedgesville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However many of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne contaminants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the very same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
