<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
