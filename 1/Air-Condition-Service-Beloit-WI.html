<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Certain immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to determine if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is very important to focus on the time and location the signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions common in the home.<p>
