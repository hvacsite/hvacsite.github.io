<h3>Electric Heating in Hazlehurst Mississippi</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>To start with, The after hours responding to service representative, John, was really respectful and expert. Second Of All, Gracion W is a timely, well-informed technician.

I likewise advise among the Security Plans, which I am a member of, if you like to conserve cash. Thank you." Karen P.<p>
