<p>Consumer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive eliminators, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms related to exposure to carbon monoxide gas. Carefully read the labels including health danger details and warns on the proper use of these products. Use items that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the location is well aerated.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
