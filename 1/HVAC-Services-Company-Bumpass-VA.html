Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room.

<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
