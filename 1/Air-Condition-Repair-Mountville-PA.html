In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
