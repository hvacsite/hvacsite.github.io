<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
