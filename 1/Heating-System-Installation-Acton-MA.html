<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can afford, numerous Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a cruel, terrible summer.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires dealt with by professionals, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
