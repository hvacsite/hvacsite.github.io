<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Aurora IL?</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
