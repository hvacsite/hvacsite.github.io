<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage.
