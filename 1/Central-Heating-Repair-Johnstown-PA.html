<p>I have been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
