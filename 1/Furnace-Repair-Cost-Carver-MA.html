When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in colder climates were heated up by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, floorings and walls warmed. In turn, the things in the room, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
