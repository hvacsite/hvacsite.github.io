<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
