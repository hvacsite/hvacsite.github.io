It takes approximately 5 hours to set up a little furnace and more to set up a large one.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
