<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Somerset MA?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
