<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Pleasant Hill CA</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their effectiveness gradually. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
