<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
