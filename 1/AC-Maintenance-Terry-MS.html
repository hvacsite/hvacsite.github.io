Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
