<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level remains continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer constant and reputable heating & cooling.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. , if it does not, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
