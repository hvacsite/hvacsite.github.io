(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
