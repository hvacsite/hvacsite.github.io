<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good individuals I have actually met in a very long time.
