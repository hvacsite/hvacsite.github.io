The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, since it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
