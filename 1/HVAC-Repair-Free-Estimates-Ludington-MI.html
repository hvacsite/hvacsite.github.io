<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>If you are replacing your existing cooling system, it's safe to presume that you already have ductwork set up.

<p>A customized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air course.

Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
