<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Abingdon VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
