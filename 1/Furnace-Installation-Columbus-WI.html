<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than numerous heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the model you purchase.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
