<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Lonoke AR</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as various as the various houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile homes, apartments, high-rise condos, row real estate, etc.).

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
