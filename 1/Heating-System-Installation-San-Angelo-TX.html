Also, real estate costs in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as a result, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels. Numerous attics are likewise being converted to finished bedrooms to add extra area. Spaces in the upper locations of homes are particularly prone to getting incredibly hot and unpleasant throughout the summer season, making air conditioning a lot more needed.<p>

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
