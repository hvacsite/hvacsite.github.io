<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Ridgeway VA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
