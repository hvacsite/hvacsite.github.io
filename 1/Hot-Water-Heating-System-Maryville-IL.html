There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
