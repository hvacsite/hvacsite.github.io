<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Salem WV</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to order it. My wife stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
