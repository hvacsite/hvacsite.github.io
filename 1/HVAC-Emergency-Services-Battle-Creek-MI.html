<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical method of reducing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will decrease but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Because smoking produces such large quantities of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your house as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it takes to substantially lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. As a result, the most efficient way to lower exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of cigarette smoking there.<p>
