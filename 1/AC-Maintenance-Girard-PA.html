<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and simple approach to reduce ambient air pollution and prospective health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the greatest energy consumers in your house, so homeowners who may be purchasing a new furnace must considering changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to save cash and assist the environment.
