<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Clayton NC 27520</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
