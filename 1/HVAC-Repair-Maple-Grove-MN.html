<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production integrates quality products and outstanding service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating items all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outside unit of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting a number of traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your system if it's five years old or older.

All quotes (get at least three, from accredited, well-regarded companies) must include this one-page hard copy.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Rather than a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these small however significant modifications in his bid. Since of recent warmer summers and for environmental reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
