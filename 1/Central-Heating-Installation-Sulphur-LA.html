<p>Improve your services, make more services income, and supply a fantastic client experience. To ensure the system you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to figure out the specific type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we don't just replace it with the very same size system you presently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is vital so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Essentially, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
