<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the house. Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items.
