<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
