<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>There's a big distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in chillier environments were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floors heated. In turn, the things in the room, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
