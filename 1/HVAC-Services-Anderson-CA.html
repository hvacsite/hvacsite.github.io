<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

Further research is needed to better understand which health effects happen after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in houses and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for short time periods.<p>
