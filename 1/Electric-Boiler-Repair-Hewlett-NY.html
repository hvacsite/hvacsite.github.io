Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
