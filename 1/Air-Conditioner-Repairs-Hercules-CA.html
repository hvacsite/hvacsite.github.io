<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in Hercules CA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
