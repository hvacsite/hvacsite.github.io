<h3>Powerful Tips for Furnace Cleaning in Leicester NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
