<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

The good news is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
