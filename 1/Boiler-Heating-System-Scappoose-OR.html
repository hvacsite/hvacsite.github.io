Based upon the typical temperature levels in our area, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years. Your heating unit will work hard for you, but like your cars and truck, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running efficiently, prevent issues, and keep your service warranty intact.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will merely run more difficult to maintain a warm climate for your home when the weather condition is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clarity on this concern, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you might try to find a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and performance.

But more intricate concerns-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be suitable.<p>
