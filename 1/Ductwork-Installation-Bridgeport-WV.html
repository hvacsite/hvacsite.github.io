<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12.
