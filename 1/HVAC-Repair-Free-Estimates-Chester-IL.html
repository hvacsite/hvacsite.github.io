<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
