He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years ago and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
