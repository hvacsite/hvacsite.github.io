<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can exacerbate issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
