<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
