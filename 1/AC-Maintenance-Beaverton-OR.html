<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my things. I like my devices and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So purchasing this a/c unit to change my old one was somewhat of a difficult truth. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in excellent manufacturing, am happy I got this however. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got since I purchased it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
