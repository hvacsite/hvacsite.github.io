<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost.
