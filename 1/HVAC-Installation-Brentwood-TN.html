<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Brentwood TN</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air, you have a couple of options when it comes to central heater. We'll jump into costs later, but you can select from a furnace, heat or boiler  pump. In general, heating systems are the most economical alternative. Nevertheless, your choice will mostly boil down to what your ducts permit or what was formerly in your house. Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable choice.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
