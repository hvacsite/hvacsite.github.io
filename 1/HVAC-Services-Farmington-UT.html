<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be efficiently recognized or fixed without a comprehensive building investigation. These examinations may begin with written surveys and telephone assessments in which structure detectives assess the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. In many cases, these inquiries might quickly reveal the issue and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
