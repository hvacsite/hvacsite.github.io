<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Addison TX</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
