Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
