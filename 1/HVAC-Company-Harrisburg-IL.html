<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health results discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed results could take place.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent need to request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
