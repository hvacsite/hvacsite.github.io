<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, think about an entire house dehumidifier.

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this data may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
