<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
