<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can differ considerably from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might require absolutely various actions and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected.
