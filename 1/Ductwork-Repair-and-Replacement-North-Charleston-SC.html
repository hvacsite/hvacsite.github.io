<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable property owners to control the temperature and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy expenses and guarantee the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will check the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to ensure the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature level, the technician needs to inspect the thermostat's performance or examine the entire HVAC system.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
