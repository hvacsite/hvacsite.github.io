<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
