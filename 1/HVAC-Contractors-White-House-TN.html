In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
