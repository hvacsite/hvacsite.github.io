<p>Information supplied in this security guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings continuously evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, products, and activities within them.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
