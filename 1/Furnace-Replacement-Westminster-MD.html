<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
