<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Allendale MI</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler generally take place. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
