<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
