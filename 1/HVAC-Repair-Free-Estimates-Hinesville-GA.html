<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") explains how inside air can impact an individual's comfort, capability, and health to work.

Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does supply standards about the most typical IAQ office grievances.<p>
