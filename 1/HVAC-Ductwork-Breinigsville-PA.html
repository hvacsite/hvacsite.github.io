<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
