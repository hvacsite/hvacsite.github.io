<p>Some health effects may appear soon after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and generally short-term.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
