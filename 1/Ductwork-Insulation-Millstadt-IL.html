<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
