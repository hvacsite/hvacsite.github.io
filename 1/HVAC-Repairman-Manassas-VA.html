<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of reducing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will reduce but not remove exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.

In addition, the large increases in ventilation it requires to considerably minimize exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Consequently, the most efficient method to minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of smoking there.<p>
