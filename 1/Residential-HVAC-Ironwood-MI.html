<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not basic, given that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
