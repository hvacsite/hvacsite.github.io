<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Great Lakes IL 60088</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has conducted. Examinations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is very important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the house from household pipes that is made with lead products. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to discover how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
