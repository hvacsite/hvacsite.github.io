<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
