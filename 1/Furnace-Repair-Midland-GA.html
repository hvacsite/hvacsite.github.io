An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, especially if you make it part of a develop or restoration project.
