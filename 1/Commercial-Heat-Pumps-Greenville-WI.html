<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies provide top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
