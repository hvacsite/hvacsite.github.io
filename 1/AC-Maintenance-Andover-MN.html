<p>Self-installation tends to produce more issues than it solves.

<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Andover MN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
