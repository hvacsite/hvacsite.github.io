The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>

<p>Often a short-lived indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex problems-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the three methods listed below may be appropriate.<p>
