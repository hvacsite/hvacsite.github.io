<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, cigarette smoking, family products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in manufactured items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and coating items.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same period. Essentially, SEER offers more data based upon how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
