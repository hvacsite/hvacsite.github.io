<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues.

There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heater in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly option, however newer systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective natural gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
