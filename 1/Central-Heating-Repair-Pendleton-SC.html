<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has enforced tighter restrictions for many years. There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heater in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least costly option, however newer systems can be really energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems typically attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective natural gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Heavy production markets utilize a reasonably small portion of air conditioning technicians and other HVAC workers, but pay a few of the market's greatest salaries. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 each year. Auto parts makers, aerospace makers and vehicle manufacturers are all within a couple of cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year.
