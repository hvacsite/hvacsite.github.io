<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just adding refrigerant is not an option if it leaks.

First, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about using solid wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>
