<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Reedley CA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have satisfied in a long period of time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
