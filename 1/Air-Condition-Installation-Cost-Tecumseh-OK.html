And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units feature a variety of special features that can even more enhance performance and efficiency. For example, homeowners may want to try to find one that includes an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy costs much more. Of course, more features mean higher central air conditioning expenses.<p>
