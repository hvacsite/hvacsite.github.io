<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To minimize contaminants, we recommend installing advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are created to remove the smallest particles from the air.

<p>A specific a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Mission Viejo CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
