Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
