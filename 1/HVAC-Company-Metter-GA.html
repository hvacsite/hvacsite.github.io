<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is designed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, smoking cigarettes, home products, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in produced items. For instance, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
