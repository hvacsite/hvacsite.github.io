<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
