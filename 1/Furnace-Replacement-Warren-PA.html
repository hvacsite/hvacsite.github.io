<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler typically take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
