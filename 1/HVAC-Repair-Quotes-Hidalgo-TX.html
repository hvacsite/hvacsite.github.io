<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we supply guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy.
