<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we supply guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions.
