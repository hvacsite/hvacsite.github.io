<h3>Determining Heat Vacuum Cleaners in Cambridge Springs PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
