<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
