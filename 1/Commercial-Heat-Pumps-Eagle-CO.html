<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
