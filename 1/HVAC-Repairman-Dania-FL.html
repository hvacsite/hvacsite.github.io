<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%.

Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
