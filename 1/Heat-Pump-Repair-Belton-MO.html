<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
