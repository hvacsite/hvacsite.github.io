An ethical company does not exploit inexpensive labor chances just because they're inexpensive. Inexpensive workmanship is generally substandard craftsmanship, and it never ever helps a company build long-term relationships with customers.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services used. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's warranty. Any major repairs ought to be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
