The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
