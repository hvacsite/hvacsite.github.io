<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Mecca CA 92254</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
