<p>A health questionnaire ought to be established and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool should determine the variety of individuals affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the workplace; suggest when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health symptoms or diseases; recognize all makers operated in the work environment; suggest the type of outside air contamination; and recognize prospective sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical incomes for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
