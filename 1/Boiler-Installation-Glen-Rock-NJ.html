During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
