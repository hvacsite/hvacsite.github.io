<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Bowling Green OH</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
