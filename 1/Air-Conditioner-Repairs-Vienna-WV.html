<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, consider prospective results of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
