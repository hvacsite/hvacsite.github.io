<h3>HVAC Supply in Coal Township Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved problems. I would advise this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
