<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
