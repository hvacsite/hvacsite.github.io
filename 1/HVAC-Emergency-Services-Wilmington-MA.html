<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
