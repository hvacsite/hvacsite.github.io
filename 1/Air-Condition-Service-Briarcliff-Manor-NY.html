<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Briarcliff Manor NY Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
