<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
