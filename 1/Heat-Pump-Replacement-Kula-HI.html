<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
