<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered fantastic customer service at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps generally need excavation to set up, which adds a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
