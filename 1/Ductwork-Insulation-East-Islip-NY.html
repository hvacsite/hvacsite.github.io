<h3>AC Repair Contractor in East Islip NY 11730</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were very expert, polite and the work was very effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Numerous individuals are ending up being more concerned and mindful about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing allergens and toxins can cover the a/c ductwork with time. Periodically it must be gotten rid of to revitalize the quality and improve of indoor air and enhance the cooling.
