Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result.
