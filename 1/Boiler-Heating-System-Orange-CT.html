<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Orange CT</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility clause" applies.

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
