<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
