<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very comprehensive in describing what services would be performed. Also Camryn supplied fantastic customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
