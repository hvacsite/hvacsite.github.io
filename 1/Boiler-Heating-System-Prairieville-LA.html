<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Prairieville LA</h3>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
