<p>A split air conditioning system might cost near that of a traditional HVAC system but has actually shown to be an alternative cost effective choice to homes that do not have ductwork. Used together with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioners, space heating systems, or oil heating systems, it can enhance the comfort of your home while keeping your regular monthly utility bill sensible.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate.

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heater, you may search for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
