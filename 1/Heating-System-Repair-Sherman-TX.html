<p>Just like most home enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary widely based upon the size of the home. A lot of heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, property owners ought to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).
