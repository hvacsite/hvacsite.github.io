<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
