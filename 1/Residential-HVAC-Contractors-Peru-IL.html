<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my stuff. I like my devices and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So buying this a/c unit to replace my old one was somewhat of a tough truth. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays.

Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place gradually due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
