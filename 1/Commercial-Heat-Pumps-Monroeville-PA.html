<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear.

Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
