<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some basic maintenance.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air.

For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about prospective effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's directions, particularly instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.
