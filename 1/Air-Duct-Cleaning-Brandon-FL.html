<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
