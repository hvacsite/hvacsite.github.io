<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
