<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>If you have a big house, a house with high ceilings, a house with many windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air may not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. House owners would be well advised to perform a home energy audit to assess where improvements may be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system.

<p>As with many home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ extensively based upon the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years.
