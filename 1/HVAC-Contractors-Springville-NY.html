<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
