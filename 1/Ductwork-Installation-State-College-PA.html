The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
