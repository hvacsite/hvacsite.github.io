<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
