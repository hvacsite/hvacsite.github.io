<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
