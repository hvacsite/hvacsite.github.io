<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for commercial and residential HVAC companies. HVAC specialists are subject to a number of possibly hazardous conditions. Service technicians are often required to work in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of homes. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather for long periods of time. Given that they are called to structures without operating environment control, they are also based on the severe hot or cold temperature levels existing inside an area.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>A customized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
