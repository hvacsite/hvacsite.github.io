Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock.

<p>No matter the type of electric radiant floor heater, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any interference or disruption in the circulation of electricity makes the system inoperable. This is among the drawbacks to installing an electric radiant heat system. However, presuming they are installed correctly and correctly taken care of, the probability of them having issues is little.<p>
