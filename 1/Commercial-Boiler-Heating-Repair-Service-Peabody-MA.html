<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Peabody MA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
