<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.
