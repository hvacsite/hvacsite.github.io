<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
