Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about using strong wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet.
