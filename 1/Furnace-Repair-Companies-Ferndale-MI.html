<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
