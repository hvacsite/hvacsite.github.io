<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
