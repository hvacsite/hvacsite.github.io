<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less regular (however often more serious) cases of individuals ending up being ill after being in a specific building at a specific time.

Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can contaminate a structure's cooling system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>You may opt to keep your service and product line simple for now if you're in the very first couple of years of organisation.

<p>We frequently install little integrated electric area heating units when we add or redesign on a room. Unlike heat pumps, these systems are self-contained.

They can be found in many different forms: wall-mounted units that are excellent for small spaces like bathrooms, cove heaters that resemble baseboard heaters but are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that offer a mild sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
