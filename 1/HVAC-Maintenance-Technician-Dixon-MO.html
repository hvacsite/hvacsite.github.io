<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many individuals presume pollution is just an outside problem, your house (and office) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe enough about direct exposure to all the things we put in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Exposure Evaluation Methodology (GROUP) studies found levels of about a dozen common natural contaminants to be 2 to 5 times greater inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the houses were found in highly industrial or rural areas. Additional TEAM research studies suggest that while people are using products consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
