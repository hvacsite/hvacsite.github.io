<p>The icing problem ends up being much more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperature levels.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
