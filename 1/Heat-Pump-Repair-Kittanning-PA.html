<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Kittanning PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
