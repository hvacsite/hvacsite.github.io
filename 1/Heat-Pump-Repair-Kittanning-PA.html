<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
