Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
