(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
