<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
