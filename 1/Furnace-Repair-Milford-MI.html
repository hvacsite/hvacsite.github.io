<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Milford Michigan</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

<p>Sean was really handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand.
