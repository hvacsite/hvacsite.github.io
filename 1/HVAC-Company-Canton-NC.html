<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
