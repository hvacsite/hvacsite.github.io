<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources may not pose a substantial health risk by themselves, a lot of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a major threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that many people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to prevent new problems from happening.

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be aware of some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Think about potential results of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater properly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
