<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
