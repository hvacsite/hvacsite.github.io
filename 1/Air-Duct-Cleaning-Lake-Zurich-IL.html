This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
