<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

<p>Lots of people underestimate the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air pollution is normally imagined as the black smoke discharged from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the home.

<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather expensive. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that must be constantly provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
