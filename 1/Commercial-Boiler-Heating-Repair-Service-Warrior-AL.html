<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Just be worried if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to preserve and understand.<p>
