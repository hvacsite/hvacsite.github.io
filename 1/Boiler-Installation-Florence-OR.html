<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
