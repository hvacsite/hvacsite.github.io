<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
