<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Client Service! Environment Pro is trustworthy and genuinely cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house once again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
