<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
