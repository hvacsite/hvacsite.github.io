<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
