<p>The company's head office is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they disperse their item in all areas in South Africa and neighboring countries, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
