<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Normally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a luxury item and more like a need. (Besides, warmed floors were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a major improvement project, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heater is a proper service for your specific home heating needs.<p>
