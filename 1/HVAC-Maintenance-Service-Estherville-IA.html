<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
