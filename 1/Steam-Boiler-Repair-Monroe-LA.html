<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competition for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical earnings for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution. If the existing system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
