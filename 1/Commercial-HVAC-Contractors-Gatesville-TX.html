Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
