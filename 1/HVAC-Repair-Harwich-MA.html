<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC experts suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>If you work in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you may unwittingly bring lead into your house on your clothing or hands.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability.
