<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
