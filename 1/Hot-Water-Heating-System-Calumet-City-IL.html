<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building materials, smoking, family items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems.

R-600 (isobutane) is currently commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>
