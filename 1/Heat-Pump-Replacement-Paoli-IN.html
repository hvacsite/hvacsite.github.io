<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Dirty Filters: â $ " Â Filters obstructed with dust, pet hair and other particles result in issues like failure to offer sufficient heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That may be a very pricey dirty-filter medical diagnosis if the technician comes to your house. This sort of cleaning work ought to be carried out in a regular basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, check our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
