<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
