<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
