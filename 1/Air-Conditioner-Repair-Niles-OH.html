<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used various approaches. The CMHC research study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or techniques utilized. The EPA study recommended and controlled approaches utilized on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
