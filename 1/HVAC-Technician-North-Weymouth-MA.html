<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home.

An air contaminant might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products.
