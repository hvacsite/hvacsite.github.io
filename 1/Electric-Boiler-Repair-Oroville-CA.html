The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.
