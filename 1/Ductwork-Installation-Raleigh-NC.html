<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
