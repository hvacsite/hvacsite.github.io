<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
