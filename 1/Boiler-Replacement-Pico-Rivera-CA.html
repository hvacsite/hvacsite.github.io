<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
