<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside contaminant, it may function as a path to bring the contaminants inside.

When the a/c unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
