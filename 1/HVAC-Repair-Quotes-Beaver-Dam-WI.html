<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
