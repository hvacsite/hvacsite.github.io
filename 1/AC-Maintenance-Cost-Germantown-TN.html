<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.
