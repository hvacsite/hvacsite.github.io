<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Heatpump work on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
