<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
