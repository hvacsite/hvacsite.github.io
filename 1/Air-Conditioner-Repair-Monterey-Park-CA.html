<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be efficiently determined or remedied without a comprehensive building examination. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building investigators evaluate the history of occupant signs and structure operation procedures. In some cases, these inquiries might quickly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury product and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated floorings were great enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a major remodeling job, it's finest to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heater is an appropriate option for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
