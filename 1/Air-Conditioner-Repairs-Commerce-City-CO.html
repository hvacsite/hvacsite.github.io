<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Commerce City CO - The Benefits</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
