<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Bluff City TN</h3>
<p>Each repair we carry out is necessary to us. Our AC technicians are expertly trained, and they continue to pursue continuous education. You'll find them well-informed about your particular AC system. The problem will be diagnosed properly and the repair performed effectively. If a system can't be fixed, we'll give you alternatives for changing it. Our AC company will make certain the entire process goes as smoothly as possible. You'll have the opportunity to authorize a price and review quote before we begin.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
