<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
