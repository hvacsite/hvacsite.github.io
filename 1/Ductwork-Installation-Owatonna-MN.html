<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
