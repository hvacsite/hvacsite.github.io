<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
