<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us for that reason. Typically they were at first thinking about remotely keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and carried out indoor air quality keeping an eye on to offer a much healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the negative repercussions connected with indoor air contaminants.<p>
