<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse.
