<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Chesnee SC</h3>

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
