<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning organisation tends to run cold and hot. Demand warms up throughout the summertime and winter season when customers require their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here.<p>
