<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Many AC systems include a variety of unique features that can further improve performance and effectiveness.
