<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>If a contractor doesn't have a strong grasp of local policies or applicable local, regional, and federal rewards-- like the ones discovered at the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency, they might leave that to you and subsequently lower their fees since they have less paperwork to stress over.
