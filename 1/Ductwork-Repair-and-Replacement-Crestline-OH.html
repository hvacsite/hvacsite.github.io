<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 on average.

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new homes are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
