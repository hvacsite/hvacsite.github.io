<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Valparaiso</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Expert heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green building movement. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all freshly developed homes in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article forecasted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working.
