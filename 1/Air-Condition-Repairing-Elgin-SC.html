<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
