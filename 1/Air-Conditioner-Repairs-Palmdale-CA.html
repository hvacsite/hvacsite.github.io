<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
