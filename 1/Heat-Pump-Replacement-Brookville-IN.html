Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building materials, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
