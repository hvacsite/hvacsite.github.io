As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
