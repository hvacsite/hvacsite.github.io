<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
