<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been finished, the last job is to evaluate the system to ensure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.
