<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
