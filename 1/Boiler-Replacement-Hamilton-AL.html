Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
