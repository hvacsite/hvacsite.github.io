Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one action specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented.

If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
