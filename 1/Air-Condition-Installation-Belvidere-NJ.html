<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a business or merchant to do the installation.

A voided service warranty will not do you any good ought to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and employ a certified person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
