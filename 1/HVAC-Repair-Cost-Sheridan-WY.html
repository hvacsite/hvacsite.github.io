<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage.

Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
