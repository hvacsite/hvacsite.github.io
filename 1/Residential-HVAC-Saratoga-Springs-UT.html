<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
