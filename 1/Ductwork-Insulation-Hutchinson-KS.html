<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Hutchinson KS</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
