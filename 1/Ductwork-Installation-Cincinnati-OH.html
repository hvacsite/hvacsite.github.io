<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
