<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Townsend GA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have fulfilled in a long time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
