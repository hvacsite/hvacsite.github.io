<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
