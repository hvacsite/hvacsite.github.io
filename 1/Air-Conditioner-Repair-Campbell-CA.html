The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, till the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
