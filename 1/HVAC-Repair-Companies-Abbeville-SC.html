<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and reliable  technique to reduce ambient air contamination and possible health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Usually the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
