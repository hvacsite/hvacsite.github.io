<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
