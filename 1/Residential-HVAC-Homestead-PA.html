<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists believed they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
