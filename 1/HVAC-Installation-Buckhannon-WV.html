<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on private level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.
