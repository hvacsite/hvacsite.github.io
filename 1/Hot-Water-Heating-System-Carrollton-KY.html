<h3>HVAC Service in Carrollton KY 41008</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>We look at ideas prior to we supply guidance to replace rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
