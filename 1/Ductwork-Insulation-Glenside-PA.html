<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
