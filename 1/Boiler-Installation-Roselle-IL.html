Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
