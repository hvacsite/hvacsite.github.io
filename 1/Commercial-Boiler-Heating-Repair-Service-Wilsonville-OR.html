Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
