<p>Information provided in this security guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings constantly evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be developing as a result of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>The first a/c unit and fridges employed poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
