<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>There are two main forms of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions.

The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
