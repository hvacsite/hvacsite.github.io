<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Dover NH</h3>

<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
