<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>

<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends upon individual sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants activate allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing contaminants. Symptoms of health problems triggered by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
