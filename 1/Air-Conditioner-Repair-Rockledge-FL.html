<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products produced indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
