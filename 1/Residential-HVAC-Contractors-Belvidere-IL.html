<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
