<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Don't stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may require 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage provided by your transformer to keep the digital display on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't gotten. There are various reasons why your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be talking about why you may be having trouble with your Nest clever thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers first. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect.
