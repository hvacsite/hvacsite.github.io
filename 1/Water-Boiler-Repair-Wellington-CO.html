<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
