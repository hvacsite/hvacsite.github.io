<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
