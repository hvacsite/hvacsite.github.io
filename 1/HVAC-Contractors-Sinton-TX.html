<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the world, consisting of EMV. He's said numerous times that the special code feature is optional and many, numerous retailers do not utilize it due to the fact that it decreases deals a lot more due to the back-and-forth interactions needed. I don't understand enough about the technology to know if that is even possible.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
