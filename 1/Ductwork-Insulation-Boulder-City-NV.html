<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain.

<p>We required 2 visits - Jake came out initially and was pleasant and extremely well-informed and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later and was likewise educated and great to talk to. They both did an excellent task. Sabre's workplace personnel is very handy, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Absolutely recommend.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
