<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
