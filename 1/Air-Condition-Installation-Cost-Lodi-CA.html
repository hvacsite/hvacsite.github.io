<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
