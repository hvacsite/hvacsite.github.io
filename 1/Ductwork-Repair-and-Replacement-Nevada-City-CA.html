This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
