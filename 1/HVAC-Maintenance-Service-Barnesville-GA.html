<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to also be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens should be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures must not be carried out till these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
