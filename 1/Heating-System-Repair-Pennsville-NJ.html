<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
