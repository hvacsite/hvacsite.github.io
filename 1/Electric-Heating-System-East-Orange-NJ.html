<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at East Orange NJ</h3>
<p>Most people understand that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have significant, harmful result. EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air pollution among the leading five ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners feature a thermostat sensing unit, situated behind the control panel, which measures the temperature level of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the air conditioning unit might cycle continuously or act unpredictably. The sensing unit needs to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
