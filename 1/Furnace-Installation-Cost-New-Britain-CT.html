<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Air, heating and ventilation Conditioning, and refers to the climate control systems set up in homes or commercial homes. Their job is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep inhabitants of the structure comfortable. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system set up.<p>
