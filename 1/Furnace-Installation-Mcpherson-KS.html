<h3>Central Heating Repair in Mcpherson KS 67460</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
