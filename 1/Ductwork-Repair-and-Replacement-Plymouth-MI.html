<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify issues.

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. A lot of contemporary warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
