They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My partner stated that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long period of time.
