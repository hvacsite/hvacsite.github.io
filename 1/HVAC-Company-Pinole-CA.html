<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
