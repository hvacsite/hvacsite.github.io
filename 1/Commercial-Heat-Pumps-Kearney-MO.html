<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big seller who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy consumption and temperatures in shops to save on costs (especially at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores change beyond an acceptable variety that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to run with the objective of selling or spinning off a firm eventually.
