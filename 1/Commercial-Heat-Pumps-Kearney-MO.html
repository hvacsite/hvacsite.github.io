<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad.

<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
