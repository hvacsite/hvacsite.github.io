This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
