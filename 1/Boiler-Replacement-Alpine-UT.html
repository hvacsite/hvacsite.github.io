<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and plumbing quality.
