<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
