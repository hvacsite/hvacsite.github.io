<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, because it is protected indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become blocked, minimizing air flow quality, volume, and distribution. They likewise might end up being places for bacteria and molds to be and grow distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be correctly preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
