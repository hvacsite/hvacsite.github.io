It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
