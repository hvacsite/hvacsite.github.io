<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of when a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
