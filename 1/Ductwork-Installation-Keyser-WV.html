<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will always be the odd problem that sometimes shows up. When you do notice your furnace acting strangely, it is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the issue worse, and often more costly.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.
