A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
