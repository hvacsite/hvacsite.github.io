<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
