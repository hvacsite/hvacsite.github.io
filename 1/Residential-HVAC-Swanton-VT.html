Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
