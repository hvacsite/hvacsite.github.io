<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
