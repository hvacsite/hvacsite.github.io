<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has actually identified structure products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, however much of the threat likewise originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>While contaminants frequently found in indoor air are responsible for lots of harmful effects, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are essential to produce specific health issue. People also react really in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is required to better understand which health results occur after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations discovered in houses and which take place from the higher concentrations that take place for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>It is not practical to design a universal standard suitable for all in terms of direct exposure and health because immunity varies considerably from private to private.
