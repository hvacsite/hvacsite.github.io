<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which generally includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
