Many common structure products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is frequently advised instead.<p>
