<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
