<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
