<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>As discussed above, triggering your new under tile floor heating system too soon, before the mortar has cured, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the service warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run before the substance had cured. And mortar manufacturers may decline warranty protection if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
