<p>UW visitors, trainees and employees ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out different activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact a person's productivity, comfort, and health.  The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and keep healthy and comfortable environments without impurities. An essential part of the program is responding to and resolving issues of building occupants about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>. Prior to picking the installation place of a/c, a number of primary aspects need to be thought about.
