I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
