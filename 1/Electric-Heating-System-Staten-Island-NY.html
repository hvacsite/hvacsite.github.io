<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
