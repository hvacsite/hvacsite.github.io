<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.
