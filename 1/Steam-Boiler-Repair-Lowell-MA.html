<p>A number of efforts envisage to lower indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from items. There are policies in France and in Germany, and many voluntary ecolabels and score systems containing low VOC emissions requirements such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Convenience 22 in Europe, in addition to California Standard CDPH Section 01350 23 and a number of others in the U.S.A.. These efforts changed the marketplace where an increasing number of low-emitting items has appeared throughout the last years.<p>

Moreover, during winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water along with its primary function of supplying space heating.
