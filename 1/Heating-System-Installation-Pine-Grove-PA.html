After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
