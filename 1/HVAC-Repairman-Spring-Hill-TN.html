<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
