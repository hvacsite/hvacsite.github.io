<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
