<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
