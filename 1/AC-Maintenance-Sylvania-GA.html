<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. Due to the fact that they only partially get rid of the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides additional information on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
