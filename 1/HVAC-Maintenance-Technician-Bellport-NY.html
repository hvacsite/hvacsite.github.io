<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
