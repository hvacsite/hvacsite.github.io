<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
