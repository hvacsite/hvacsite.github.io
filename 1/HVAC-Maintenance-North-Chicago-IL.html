<h3>Electric Furnace in North Chicago IL 60064</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
