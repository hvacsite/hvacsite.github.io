<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Apex North Carolina</h3>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>There's no leaving that all devices ages with time. But that does not imply that older chillers can not take advantage of mechanical upgrades. We provide a variety of modernization, retrofit and upgrade options for numerous equipment types.

Cooling tower retrofits and other ancillary equipment in your HVAC portfolio can be modernized with immediate influence on your bottom line.
