<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
