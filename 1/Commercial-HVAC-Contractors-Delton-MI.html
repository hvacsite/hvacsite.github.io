<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply glowing systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
