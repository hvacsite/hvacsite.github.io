<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.
