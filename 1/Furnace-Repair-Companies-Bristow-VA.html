<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
