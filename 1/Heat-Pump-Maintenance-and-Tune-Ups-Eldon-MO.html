<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not basic, given that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
