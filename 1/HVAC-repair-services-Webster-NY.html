<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably decreases direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Improper adjustment, typically suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.
