<p>There are 2 main types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating business. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than lots of heat pump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending on the design you buy. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This suggests it can heat up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
