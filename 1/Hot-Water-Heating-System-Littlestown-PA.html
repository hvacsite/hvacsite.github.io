<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
