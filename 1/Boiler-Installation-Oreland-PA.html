<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Oreland PA?</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
