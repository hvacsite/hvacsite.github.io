These convection heating systems are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A Trane air conditioning unit can range in rate from $4,000 - $10,000. Our pricing guide explains all the elements that affect your cost.
