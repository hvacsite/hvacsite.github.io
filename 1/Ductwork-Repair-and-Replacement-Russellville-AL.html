An air pollutant could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
