<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Estacada OR</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
