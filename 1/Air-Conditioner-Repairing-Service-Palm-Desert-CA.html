The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
