<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Hobbs New Mexico</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
