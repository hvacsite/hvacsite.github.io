<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
