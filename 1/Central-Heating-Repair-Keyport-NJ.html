<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Keyport NJ 07735</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
