<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is generally recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
