You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>

<p>Glowing heater do not use ducts, that makes them a fair bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also don't develop cold and hot areas. All of the heat that radiant heating systems disperse moves through solid items, keeping the heat near the floor of the room where it is the most use.
