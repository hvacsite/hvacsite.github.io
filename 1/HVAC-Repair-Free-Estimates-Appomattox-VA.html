<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Appomattox VA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house building is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the home.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
