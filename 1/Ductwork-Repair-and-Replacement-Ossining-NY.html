<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Ossining NY 10562</h3>

They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
