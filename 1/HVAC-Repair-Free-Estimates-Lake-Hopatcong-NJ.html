<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
