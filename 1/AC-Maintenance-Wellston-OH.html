<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
