There have been awkward noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the beginning. However then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
