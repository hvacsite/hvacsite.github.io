<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also without delay followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you each time they come to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
