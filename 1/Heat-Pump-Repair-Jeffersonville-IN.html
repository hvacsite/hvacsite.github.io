<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
