<p>In general, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional Heating and coolings.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
