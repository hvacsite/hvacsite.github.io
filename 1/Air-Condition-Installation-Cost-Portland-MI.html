<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements.
