<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe.

Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
