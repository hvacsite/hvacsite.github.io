<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A skilled technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and efficiency of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
