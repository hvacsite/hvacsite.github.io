<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<h3>Radiant Heating System in Middletown New Jersey</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working.
