<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the very same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
