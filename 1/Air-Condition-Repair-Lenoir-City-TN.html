Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space.

Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
