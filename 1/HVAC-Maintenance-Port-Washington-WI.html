If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Port Washington WI 53074</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
