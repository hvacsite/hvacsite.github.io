He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
