This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
