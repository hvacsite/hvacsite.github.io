<p>A health questionnaire should be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool ought to recognize the number of people affected; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they are located within the workplace; suggest when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of specific health symptoms or illnesses; identify all machines operated in the work environment; suggest the kind of outside air contamination; and recognize possible sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
