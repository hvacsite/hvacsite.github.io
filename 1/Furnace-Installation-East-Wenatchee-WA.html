<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
