<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
