<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Latta SC 29565</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>
