<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
