<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Their rates was directly in line with the level of service that was offered too, the specialists discussed exactly what they were looking and doing for every step of the method while they were here.

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a luxury product and more like a necessity.
