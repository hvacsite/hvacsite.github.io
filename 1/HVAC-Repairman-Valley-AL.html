<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
