And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
