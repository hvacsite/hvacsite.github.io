Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
