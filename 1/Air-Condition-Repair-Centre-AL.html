<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
