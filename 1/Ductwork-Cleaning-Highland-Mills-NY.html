<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Employers are needed to follow the General Task Stipulation of the OSHAct, which requires them to provide workers with a safe work environment that does not have any known dangers that cause or are most likely to trigger death or severe injury. The OSHAct also needs companies to obey occupational security and health standards produced under it. Employers must be reasonably knowledgeable about the possible sources of bad air quality, and they must have the resources required to recognize and control workplace dangers. It is also their duty to inform staff members of the instant threats that are present.Specific state and local guidelines may apply.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
