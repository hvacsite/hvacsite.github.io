<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Oil heating systems are typically not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however the majority of do not accomplish an efficiency greater than 90%.
