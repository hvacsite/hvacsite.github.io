Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
