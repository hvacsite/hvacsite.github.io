Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>

In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
