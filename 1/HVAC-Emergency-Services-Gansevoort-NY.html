<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. A standard air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
