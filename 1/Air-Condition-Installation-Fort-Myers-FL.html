<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your house properly.

<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold notifies. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the scenario immediately.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area.
