<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Brighton MI</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
