<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
