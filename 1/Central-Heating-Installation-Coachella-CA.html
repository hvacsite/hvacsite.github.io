<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently.
