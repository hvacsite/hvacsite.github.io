<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
