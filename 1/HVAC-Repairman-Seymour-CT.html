Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
