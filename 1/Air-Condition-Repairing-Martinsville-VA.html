<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
