<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
