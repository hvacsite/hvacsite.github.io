<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
