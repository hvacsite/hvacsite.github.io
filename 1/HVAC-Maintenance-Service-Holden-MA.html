<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
