<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
