<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
