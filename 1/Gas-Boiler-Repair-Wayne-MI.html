The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, considering that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not basic, considering that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
