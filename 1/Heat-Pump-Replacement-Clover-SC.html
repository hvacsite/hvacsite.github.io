<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality problem is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated concerns-- identified by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics below might be appropriate.<p>
