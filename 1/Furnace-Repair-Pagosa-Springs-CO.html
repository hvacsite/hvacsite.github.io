<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Pagosa Springs CO</h3>

After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you understand it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate results that are frequently mistaken for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, fatigue, disorientation and queasiness. The effects of CO exposure can differ greatly from individual to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
