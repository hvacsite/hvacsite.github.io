<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products provide a danger just when they are managed in a manner that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled.

This can lead to the potential for considerable health problems.<p>
