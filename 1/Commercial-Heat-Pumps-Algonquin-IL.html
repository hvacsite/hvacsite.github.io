<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
