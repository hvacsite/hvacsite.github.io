First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
