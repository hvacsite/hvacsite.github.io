<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
