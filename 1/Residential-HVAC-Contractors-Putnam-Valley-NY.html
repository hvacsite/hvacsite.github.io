AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so.

<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
