<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
