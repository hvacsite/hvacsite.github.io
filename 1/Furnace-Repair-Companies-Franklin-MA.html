<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Franklin MA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
