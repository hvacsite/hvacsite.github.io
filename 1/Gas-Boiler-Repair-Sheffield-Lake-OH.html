<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
