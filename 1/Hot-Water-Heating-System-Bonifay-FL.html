<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
