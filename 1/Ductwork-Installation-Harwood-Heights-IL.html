<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
