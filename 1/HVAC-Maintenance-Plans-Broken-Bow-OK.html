<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration. Basically, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
