Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
