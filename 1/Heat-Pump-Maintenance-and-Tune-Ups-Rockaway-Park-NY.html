<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
