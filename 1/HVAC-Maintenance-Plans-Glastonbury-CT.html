He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
