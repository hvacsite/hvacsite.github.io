<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
