<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
