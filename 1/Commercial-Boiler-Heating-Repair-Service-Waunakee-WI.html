<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
