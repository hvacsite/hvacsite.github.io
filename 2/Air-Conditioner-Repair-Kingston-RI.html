<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can become blocked with debris that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
