An air toxin could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products.
