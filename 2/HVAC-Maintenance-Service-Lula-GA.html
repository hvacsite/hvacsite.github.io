Carry on to another contractor if the one you're considering wants to determine the right system for your house entirely on experience. Though highly influenced by where you live, a number of factors impact the size unit required, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun.
