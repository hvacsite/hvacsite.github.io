<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
