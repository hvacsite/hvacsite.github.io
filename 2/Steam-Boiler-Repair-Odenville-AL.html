<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Odenville AL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
