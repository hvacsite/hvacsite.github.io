<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
