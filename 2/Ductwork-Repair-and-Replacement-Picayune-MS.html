<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
