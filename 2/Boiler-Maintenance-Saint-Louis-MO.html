<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
