<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
