<p>While pollutants frequently discovered in indoor air are accountable for many damaging results, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce particular health problems. Individuals also react very in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is needed to better comprehend which health effects take place after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the higher concentrations that take place for short time periods.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
