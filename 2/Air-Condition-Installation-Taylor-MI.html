<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
