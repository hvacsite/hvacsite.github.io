<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
