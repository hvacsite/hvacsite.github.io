<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
