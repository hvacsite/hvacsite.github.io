<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
