If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Heating systems that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly.

Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with just one air conditioning filter require replacing more often.<p>
