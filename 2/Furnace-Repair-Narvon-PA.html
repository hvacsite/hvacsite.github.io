<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant resulting from natural gas that gets away into your home without being burned off. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
