<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
