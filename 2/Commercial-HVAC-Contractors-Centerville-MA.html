<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house.
