<p>When central air conditioning service fails during a heat spell, you might need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll probably pay at least a number of hundred for the repair. But if you're comfy working around electricity and want to spend about $50 on parts, you can probably repair your air conditioning service yourself in about 2 hours and conserve about $225 on parts markup and labor.<p>
