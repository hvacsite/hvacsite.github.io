If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't have the ability to cool the house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you need to take into consideration when looking for a new AC system. Each option can and will considerably impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
