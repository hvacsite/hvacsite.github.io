<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
