<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
