If your heating unit is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
