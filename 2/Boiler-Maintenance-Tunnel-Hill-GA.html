<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Tunnel Hill GA</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility clause" applies. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer needs to provide a healthy and safe office. Thus, ensuring the air is of good quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
