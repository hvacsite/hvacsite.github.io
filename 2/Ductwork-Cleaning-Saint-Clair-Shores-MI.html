<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
