<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual ought to be called for practically any maintenance other than routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be expertly examined and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup.

<p>New heaters are considerably more efficient than those of 10 or more years ago, cutting costs by as much as 30%.
