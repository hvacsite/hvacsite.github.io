<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
