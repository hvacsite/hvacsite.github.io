<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and structure residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the type of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning products, construction activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
