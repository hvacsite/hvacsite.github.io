At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning system consists of two main parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided air conditioning unit count on a set of pipelines to link the outside to the inside air unit which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split a/c installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to generate either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
