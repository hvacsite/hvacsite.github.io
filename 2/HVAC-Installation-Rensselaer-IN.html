<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems.

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
