<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be effectively identified or fixed without a comprehensive structure investigation. These investigations might begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure investigators evaluate the history of resident signs and building operation treatments. In some cases, these queries may rapidly reveal the issue and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Because resistance differs considerably from private to individual, it is not practical to design a universal standard fit for all in terms of exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a ten years study examining more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were gathered across the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples evaluated were checked favorable for fungis and bacteria.<p>
