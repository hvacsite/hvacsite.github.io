<p>I was extremely happy in the beginning since things ran smoothly with no noise. Additionally, I saw visible changes in my electricity bills. After two years, things began to change. There have been uncomfortable noises. I got it inspected and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the concern. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. But then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a business or retailer to do the installation.

A voided guarantee won't do you any good must the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
