<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
