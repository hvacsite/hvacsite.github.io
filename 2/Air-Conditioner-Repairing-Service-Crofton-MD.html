<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled.
