<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
