<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the problem location in looking over the costs. He dealt with the concern in one day, had changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what might have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
