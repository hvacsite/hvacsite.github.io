<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having defective ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy bills will increase. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the whole house will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a manufacturer's warranty. Any major repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty. However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
