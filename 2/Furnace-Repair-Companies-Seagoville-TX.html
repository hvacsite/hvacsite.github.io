<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
