<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
