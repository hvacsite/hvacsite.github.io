<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Suisun City CA</h3>
<p>Radiant heat systems are significantly popular, specifically in the previous quarter-century as technology has actually advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in reliability and economy.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
