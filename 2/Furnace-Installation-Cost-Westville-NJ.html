<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than space ac system. In addition, they are out of the way, peaceful, and convenient to operate. To conserve energy and cash, you should try to buy an energy-efficient a/c unit and lower your central air conditioning conditioner's energy use.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the toxin source away from occupants or even relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which typically is placed on a roofing system or on a concrete piece beside your home's structure.
