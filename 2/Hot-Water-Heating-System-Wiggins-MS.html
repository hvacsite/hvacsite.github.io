The quality of air in residential buildings has actually ended up being an important problem to homeowners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination studies have determined several impurities that can be present in indoor air.

Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are essential in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a new building. Required air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heat systems will require water-to-water heatpump.
