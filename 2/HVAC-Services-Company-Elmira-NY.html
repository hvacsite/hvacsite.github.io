<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
