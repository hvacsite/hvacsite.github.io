Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
