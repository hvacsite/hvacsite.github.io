In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
