<p>Let's begin by detailing the planning that requires to occur before you actually purchase a furnace. Choosing a furnace for your house isn't as basic as picking one off a showroom floor. Not all furnaces benefit all houses, and there are a number of elements that definitely need to be thought about prior to choosing one. First, you'll need one that is properly sized for your home.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
