<p>I have actually been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have actually maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really well-informed. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was obviously reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
