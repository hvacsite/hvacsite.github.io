<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Braddock PA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
