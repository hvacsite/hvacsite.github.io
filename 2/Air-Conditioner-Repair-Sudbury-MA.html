PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
