<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
