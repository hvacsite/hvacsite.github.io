<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. The majority of systems feature a kit that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will ensure a secure and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra support, especially for bigger ac system, consider buying a steel support bracket and mount it to the outdoors home wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
