<p>Professional heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC experts recommend following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>

Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
