<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Clarence NY</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's products and services was excellent. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
