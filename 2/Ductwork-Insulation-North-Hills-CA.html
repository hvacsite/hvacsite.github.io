<h3>Heating Installation in North Hills California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in North Hills CA?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
