<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs entirely by offering a professional quote with options, without pressing extra items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
