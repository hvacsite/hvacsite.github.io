If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
