<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
