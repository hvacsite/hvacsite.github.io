This is an excellent opportunity to determine parts that are used or defective. Replacing them to fix the cooling may be a lot less expensive when the problem is relatively small.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
