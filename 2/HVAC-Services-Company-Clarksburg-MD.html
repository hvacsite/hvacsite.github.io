<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, smoking, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in produced products. For instance, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
