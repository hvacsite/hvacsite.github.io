<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
