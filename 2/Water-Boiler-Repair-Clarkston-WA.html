<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
