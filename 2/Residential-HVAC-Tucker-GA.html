<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Tucker GA</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
