<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
