<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
