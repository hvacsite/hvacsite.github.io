<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up.

A dirty filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
