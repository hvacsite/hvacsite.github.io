<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
