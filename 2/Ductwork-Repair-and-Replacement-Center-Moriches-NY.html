As a society, we make sure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>1. Central Air Conditioning Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate environment, where the temperature level does not get expensive or too low.

The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation typically costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which generally suggests it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>
