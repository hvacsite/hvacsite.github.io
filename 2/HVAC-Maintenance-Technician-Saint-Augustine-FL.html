<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
