<h3>AC Technician in Odessa Texas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
