<h3>HVAC Repair in Dundalk Maryland</h3>
<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the contaminant source far from occupants or even relocating vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very important to maintaining an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
