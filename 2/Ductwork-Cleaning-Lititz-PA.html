<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Lititz PA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
