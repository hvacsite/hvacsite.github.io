<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Lanham MD 20706</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, expert and very well done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do.

I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss detail that creates a job effectively done. I very extremely recommend the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
