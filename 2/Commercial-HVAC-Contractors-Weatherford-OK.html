<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
