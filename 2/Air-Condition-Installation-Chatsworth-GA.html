The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
