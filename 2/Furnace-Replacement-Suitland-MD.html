<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
