<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they ought to be put. Most typically they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if individuals primarily remain seated in that specific area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside buildings are usually near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
