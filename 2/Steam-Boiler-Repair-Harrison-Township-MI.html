<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Harrison Township MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
