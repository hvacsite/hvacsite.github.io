<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Ravenswood WV</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
