<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
