<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
