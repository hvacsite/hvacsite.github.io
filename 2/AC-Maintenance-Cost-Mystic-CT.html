<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
