<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
