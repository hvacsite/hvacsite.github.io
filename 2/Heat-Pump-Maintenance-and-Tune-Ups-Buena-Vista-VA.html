What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
