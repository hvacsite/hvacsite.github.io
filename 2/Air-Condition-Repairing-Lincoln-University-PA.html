He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
