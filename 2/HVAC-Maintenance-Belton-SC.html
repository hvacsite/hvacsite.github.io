<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Belton SC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of house heating-- convection.
