<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

When customers require their HVAC systems repaired for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition shows up, need warms up throughout the summer and winter.<p>
