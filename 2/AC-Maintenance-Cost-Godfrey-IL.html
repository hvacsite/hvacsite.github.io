<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
