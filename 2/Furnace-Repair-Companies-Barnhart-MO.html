<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually become an important problem to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution studies have actually identified a number of pollutants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion items, unstable natural compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these pollutants are necessary in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
