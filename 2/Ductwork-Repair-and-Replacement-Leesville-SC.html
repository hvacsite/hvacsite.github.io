<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Leesville SC 29070</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine scenario & decided to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were extremely expert, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Consider a whole home dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to validate replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and making it possible for greater comfort at higher temperatures.<p>
<p>Think about potential results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
