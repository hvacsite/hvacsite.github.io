<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely including refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. A trained technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to think about when attempting to determine how often I need to change my a/c filters.

Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one air conditioning filter require replacing more often.<p>
<h3>Ductwork Installation in Alton Illinois</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
