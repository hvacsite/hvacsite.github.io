<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
