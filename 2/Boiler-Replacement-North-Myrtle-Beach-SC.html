<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in North Myrtle Beach SC 29582</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the difficulty location in looking over the costs. He solved the problem in one day, had actually adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have caused the problem and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have actually considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
