<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual must be called for nearly any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioners must be professionally examined and changed before the start of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>
