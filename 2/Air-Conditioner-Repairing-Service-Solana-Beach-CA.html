<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents.
