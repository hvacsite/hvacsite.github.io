Based on the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected lifespan of 15 years. Your heater will work hard for you, but like your car, doing routine and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, avoid problems, and keep your warranty intact.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
