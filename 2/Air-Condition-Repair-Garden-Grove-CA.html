<p>Measurement procedures are being established and demonstrated to evaluate structure ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These procedures range from sophisticated tracer gas techniques used mainly in building research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by constructing operators.

The outdoor unit must likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully discharged outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioning unit systems in easily accessible places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
