<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
