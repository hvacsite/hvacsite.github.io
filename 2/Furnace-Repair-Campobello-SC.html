<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
