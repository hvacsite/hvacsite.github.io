<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Uxbridge MA Home Owners</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
