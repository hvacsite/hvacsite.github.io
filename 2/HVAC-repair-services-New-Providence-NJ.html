<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
