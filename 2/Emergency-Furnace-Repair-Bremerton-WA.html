<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back.

We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
