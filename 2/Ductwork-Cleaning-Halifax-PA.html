<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They utilize a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the space. The bigger the area, the more powerful the home heater needs to be. For already constructed home heater, the contractor will need to remove the old furnace to include the new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation costs.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
