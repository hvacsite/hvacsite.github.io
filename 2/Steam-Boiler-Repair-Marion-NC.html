ProTex properly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

<p>Your concerns or issues about indoor air problems can regularly be responded to by the government companies in your state or local government.
