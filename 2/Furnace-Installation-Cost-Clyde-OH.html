<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new resident I have actually found out how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
