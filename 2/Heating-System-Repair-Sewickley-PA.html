<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually greater than many heat pump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you acquire.

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
