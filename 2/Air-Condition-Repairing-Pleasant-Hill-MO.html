<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Pleasant Hill MO 64080</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
