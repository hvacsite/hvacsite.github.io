<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
