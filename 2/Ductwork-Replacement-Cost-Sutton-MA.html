<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners.
