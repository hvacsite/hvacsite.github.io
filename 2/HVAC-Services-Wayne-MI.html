<h3>Suggestions to Prevent Furnace Repairing Costs in Wayne MI</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
