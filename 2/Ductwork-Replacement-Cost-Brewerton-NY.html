<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
