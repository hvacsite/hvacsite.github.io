<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, especially in an older home. Depending on the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, specific fuels and equipment might need unique authorizations, and there is minimal versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
