<p>For instance, issues emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient quantities of outside air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.
