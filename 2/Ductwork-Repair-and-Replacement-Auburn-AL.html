<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Auburn AL 36830</h3>

From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which generally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
