<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
