I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
