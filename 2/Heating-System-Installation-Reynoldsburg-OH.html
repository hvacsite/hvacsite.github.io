<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
