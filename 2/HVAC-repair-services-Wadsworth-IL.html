<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Wadsworth IL 60083</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
