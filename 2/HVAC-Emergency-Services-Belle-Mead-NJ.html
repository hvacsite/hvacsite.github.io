It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost.
