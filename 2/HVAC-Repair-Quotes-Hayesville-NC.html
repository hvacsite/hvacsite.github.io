<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
