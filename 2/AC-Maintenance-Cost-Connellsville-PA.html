<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
