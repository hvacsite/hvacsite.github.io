Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
