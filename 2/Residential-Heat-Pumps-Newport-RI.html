<p>First make sure the air filter is tidy and in good condition if you see a decrease in heat output. Next, check other elements of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, debris and dust, an inexpensive repair that can assist boost efficiency. Also, check the vents and ducts for obstruction.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
