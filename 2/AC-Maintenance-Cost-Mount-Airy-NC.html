<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

In general, heaters are the most economical choice. However, your option will largely come down to what your ducts enable or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most appropriate option.<p>
