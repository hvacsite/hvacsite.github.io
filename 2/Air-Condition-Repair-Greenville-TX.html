<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires managed by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
