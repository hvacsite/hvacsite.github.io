<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
