<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
