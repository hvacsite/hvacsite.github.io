<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.

Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
