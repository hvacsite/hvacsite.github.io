<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about.

Packaged units are great for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
