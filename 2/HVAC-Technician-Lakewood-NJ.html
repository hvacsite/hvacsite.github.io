<h3>Portable Air Conditioner in Lakewood NJ 08701</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
