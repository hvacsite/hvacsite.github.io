<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems in Ocean City MD</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
