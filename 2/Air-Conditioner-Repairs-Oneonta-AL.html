<p>A health questionnaire ought to be established and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool needs to identify the number of people affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they lie within the office; indicate when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of particular health signs or diseases; identify all makers run in the workplace; suggest the type of outdoors air contamination; and identify possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than numerous heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you purchase.

This means it can heat up your house to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
