<h3>Ventilation System in Great Falls VA 22066</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, given that it is protected inside. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>

Our local furnace maintenance experts are prepared to offer your furnace with the attention it needs to last for many years to come.
