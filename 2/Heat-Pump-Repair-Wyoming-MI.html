<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, workplaces and schools matters, especially considering that we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>For example, issues occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a method that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system.
