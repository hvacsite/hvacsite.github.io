If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
