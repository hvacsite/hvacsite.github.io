<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly hard for your lungs to function correctly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
