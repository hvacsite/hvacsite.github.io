<p>We take a look at clues before we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the present system has actually not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
