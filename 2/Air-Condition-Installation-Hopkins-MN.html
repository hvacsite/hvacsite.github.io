<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
