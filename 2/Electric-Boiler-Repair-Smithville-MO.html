<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
