<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
