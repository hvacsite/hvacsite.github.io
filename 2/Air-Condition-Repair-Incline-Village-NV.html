<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain.
