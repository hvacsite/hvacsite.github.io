<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
