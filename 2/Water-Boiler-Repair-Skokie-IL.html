It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>

As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we do not think adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).
