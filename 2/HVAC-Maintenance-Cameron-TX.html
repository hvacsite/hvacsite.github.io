<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
