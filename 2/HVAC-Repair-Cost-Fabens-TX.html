We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Homes can have the very same indoor air issues as single-family houses due to the fact that a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior building products, home furnishings, and home products, are similar.

Maybe Realtors must consider too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That said, homebuyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>

Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
