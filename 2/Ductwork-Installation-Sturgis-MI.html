As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.
