<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
