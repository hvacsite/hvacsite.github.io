Thankfully, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place.

For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy.
