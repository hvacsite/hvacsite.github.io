This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room a/c offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
