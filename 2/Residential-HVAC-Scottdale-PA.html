<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house, plan on spending several thousand dollars for the total system. The size of the system identifies the labor hours included to construct the system. To outfit a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand name new furnace or more when you think about installation costs upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the area. The larger the area, the more powerful the home heating unit needs to be. For already built house heating systems, the contractor will need to eliminate the old furnace to add the new one. These charges will be included in the installation expenses.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
