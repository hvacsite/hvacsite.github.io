<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system.

However, considering current modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
