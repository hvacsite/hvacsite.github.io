<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is typically utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.

In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
