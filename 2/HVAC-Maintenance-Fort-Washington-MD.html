<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Fort Washington MD</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been finished, the last task is to test the system to make certain it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This last check may explain faults in the thermostat, which may be as simple as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to switch on may just involve a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any problems or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the issue and repaired very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do recognize a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and choose to install it in your house, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs.
