<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

To save energy and cash, you need to try to buy an energy-efficient air conditioning system and minimize your central air conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned home, cooling consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, causing power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
