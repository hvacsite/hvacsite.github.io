<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
