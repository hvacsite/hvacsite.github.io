Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly situated outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

<p>New air conditioning unit typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score means higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER score for you depends upon your house size, where you live and other elements.

<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to also be checked frequently. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire threat. Disconnected fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system as well. Soot can accumulate in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an effect on the system's performance as well.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
