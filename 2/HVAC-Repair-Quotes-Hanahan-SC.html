<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
