<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is truthful, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
