<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource area recommends that "Air Filtration should have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to lower the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<p>To be truthful, few of the centers managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Most of the time they were at first thinking about remotely monitoring some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs.

<p>It is not recommended that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality meets a certain requirement.

These limitations may not be proper in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
