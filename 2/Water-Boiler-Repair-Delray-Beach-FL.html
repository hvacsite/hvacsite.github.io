<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure products used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum since the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal process. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently advised instead.<p>
