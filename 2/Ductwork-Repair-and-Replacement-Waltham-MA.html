<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your home might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To identify odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
