<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance.
