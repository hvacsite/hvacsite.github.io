<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioner and heat pump ought to be free of all blockages and debris. Obstructions can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and trigger moisture accumulation within the system. Excess moisture can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, irregular temperature level regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to guarantee all excess wetness flows far from the system.<p>
