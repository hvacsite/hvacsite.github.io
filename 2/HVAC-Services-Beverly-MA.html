<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater wages for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or simply a high level of competition for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average earnings for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. However, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
