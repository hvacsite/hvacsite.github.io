<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
