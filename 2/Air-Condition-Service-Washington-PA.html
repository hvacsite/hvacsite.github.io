<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
