<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
