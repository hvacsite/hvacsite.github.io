<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
