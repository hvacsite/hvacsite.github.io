<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
