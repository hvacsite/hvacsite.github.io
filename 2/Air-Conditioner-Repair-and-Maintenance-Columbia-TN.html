<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
