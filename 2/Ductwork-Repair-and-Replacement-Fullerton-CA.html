<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
