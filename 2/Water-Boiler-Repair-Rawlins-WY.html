<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness indoors is connected with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC service technicians typically discover themselves working in uneasy and confined areas, at extreme heights, and sometimes in unsafe conditions like extreme weather (to service outside heat pumps and heat exchangers).
