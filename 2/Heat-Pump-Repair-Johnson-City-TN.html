<p>If you see a decline in heat output, first make certain the air filter is tidy and in excellent condition. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any accumulation of debris, dust and dirt, an inexpensive repair that can help enhance performance. Likewise, examine the vents and ducts for blockage.
