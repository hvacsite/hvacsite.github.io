<h3>Floor Heating System in Torrington Connecticut</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is secured indoors. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up.
