<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in location.

Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, causing cracks and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a really beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
