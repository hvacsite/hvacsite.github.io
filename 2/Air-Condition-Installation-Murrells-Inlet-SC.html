A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external unit.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
