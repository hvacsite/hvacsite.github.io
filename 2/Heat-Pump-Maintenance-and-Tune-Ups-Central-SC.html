<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, however lead to other health issues.

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location.

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing holes and cracks. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a really advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
