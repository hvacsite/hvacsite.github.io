<p>The most typical type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least pricey option, but more recent systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly efficient natural gas heating systems can attain AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, human beings exhale co2, which in small quantities is not harmful, but might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to build up. Germs or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
