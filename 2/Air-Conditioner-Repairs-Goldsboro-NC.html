<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
