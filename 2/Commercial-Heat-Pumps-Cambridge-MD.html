<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
