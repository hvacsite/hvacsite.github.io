<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if essential, update the structure envelope.
