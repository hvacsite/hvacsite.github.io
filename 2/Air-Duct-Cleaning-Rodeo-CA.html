<p>Specialist heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can become blocked with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be performed in simply a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
