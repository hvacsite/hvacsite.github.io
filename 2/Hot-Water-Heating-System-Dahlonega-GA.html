<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
