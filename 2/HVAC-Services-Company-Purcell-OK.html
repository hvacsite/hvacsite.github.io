<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
