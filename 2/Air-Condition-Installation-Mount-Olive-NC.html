<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized structure products, home furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the risk also comes from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>While toxins commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for many damaging effects, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce specific health issue. People also respond extremely differently to exposure to indoor air toxins. More research study is needed to much better understand which health effects take place after exposure to the typical toxin concentrations discovered in houses and which occur from the greater concentrations that happen for brief periods of time.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
