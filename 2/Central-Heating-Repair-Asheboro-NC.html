<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to provide threshold notifies. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your tracking equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to resolve the scenario immediately.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
