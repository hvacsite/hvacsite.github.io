He included these considerable however minor modifications in his quote. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological factors, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and pipes.
