Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family house installation business totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
