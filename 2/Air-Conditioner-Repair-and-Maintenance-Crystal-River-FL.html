<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
