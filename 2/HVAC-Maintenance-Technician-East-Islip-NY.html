<p>Air pollutants can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air.

The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
