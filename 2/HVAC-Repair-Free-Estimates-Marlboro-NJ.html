The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
