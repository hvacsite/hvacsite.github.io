<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
