<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
