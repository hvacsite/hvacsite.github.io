<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, volatile organic substances ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and using ventilation to dilute contaminants are the main methods for enhancing indoor air quality in many structures.

<p>When the temperature levels keep climbing up, geothermal air conditioning is a wise and cost-effective  method to cool down your house or location of company.

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power depends on routine sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and reliable  source of energy.<p>
