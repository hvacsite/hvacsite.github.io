<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.
