<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
