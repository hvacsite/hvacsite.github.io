<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Flushing NY 11355</h3>
<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
