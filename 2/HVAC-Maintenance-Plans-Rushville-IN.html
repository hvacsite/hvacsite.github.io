<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
