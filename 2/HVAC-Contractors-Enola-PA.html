<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which differs tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
