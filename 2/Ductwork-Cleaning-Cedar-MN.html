<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
