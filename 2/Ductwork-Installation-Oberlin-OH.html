<p>It's not recommended for uncertified people to repair & check cooling & HVAC equipment. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a qualified ac repair Houston Midtown tech for appropriate HVAC medical diagnosis, it would be best. When examining your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, always make sure.
