<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness.

<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin.
