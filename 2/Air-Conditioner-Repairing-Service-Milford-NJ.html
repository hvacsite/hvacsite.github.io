<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
