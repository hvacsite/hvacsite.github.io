<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
