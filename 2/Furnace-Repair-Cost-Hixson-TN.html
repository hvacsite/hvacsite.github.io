<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of lowering exposure to indoor air contaminants, likewise will reduce but not remove direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Since smoking cigarettes produces such big amounts of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your house as quickly as they develop. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to substantially decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Subsequently, the most efficient method to decrease exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
