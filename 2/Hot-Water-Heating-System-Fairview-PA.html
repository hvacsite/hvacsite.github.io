A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
