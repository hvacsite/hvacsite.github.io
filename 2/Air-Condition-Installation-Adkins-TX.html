<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. There are several design methods in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response information which reveal the health impacts of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical. Comparable data is not readily available for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a combination of contaminants as is the case for IAQ problems.
