<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
