<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Millbrae CA 94030</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
