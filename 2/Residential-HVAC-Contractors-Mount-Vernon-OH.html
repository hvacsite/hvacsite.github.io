<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that routinely monitors energy usage and temperature levels in shops to save money on costs (especially in the evening) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops change beyond an appropriate variety that might prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
