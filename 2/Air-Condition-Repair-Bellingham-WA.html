It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.
