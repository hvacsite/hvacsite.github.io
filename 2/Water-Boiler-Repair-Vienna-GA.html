<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Vienna GA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
