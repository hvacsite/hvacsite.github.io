<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

The absence of moving parts implies you're less likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
