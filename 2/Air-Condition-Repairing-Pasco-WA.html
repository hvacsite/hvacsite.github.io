An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
