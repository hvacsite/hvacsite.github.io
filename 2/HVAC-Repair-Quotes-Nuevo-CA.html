<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
