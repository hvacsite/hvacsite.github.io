<p>Installing cooling costs between $3,350 and $5,912 with many property owners reporting spending $4,631 typically. This price is typical of installing a new AC system to your forced air furnace. Other choices consist of single window systems or portable units for $234 to $700 or ductless mini splits for $660 to $4,500. Your total cost depends upon the type and size of air conditioning system you need.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To detect odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
