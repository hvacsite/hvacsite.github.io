<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants.

For example, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to save money on the energy expenses and ensure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will check the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to make sure the real temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature level, the technician needs to inspect the thermostat's performance or assess the whole HVAC system.<p>
