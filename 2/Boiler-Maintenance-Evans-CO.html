<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually become an important problem to house owners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination research studies have actually determined a number of impurities that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>
