Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can imply substantial savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A/c manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioning system fails, start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers.

These limits may not be suitable in workplace settings or for the house.<p>
