<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
