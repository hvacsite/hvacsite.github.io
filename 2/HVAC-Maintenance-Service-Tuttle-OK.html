<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
