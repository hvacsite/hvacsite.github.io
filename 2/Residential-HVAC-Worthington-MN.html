<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Worthington MN 56187</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to examine scenario & decided to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going however also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were extremely professional, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many AC units come with a number of special functions that can even more improve efficiency and performance. For instance, homeowners may wish to search for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter requires to be altered. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy costs much more. Of course, more functions suggest greater central air conditioning expenses.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
