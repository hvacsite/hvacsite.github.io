<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental expenses. Because the energy used to heat your house is drawn out directly from the ground, it safeguards the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.
