Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
