<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Frankenmuth MI Home</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
