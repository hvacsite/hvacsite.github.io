Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of recurring usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.. a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
