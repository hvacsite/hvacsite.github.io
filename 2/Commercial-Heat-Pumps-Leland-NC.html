<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
