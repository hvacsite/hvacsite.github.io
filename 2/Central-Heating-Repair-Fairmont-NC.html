<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
