<p>We take a look at ideas before we provide suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
