<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. You can prevent all these problems by ensuring that your system is examined regularly, as this will avoid even minor repairs from ending up being substantial concerns.

<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
