<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
