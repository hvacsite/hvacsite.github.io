Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c.
