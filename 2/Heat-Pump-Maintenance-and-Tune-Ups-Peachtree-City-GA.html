<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
