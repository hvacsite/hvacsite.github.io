<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
