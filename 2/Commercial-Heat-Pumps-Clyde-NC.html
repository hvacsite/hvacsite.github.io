<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>

She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
