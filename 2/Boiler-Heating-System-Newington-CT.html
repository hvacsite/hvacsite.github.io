<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.
