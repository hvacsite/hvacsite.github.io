<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat transferred heat to other short articles in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
