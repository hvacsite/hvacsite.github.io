<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Berlin New Hampshire</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
