<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control involves moving the toxin source away from occupants or perhaps moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, condenser, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece beside your house's foundation. This type of ac system also is used in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is normally located outdoors. Packaged air conditioners often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of air conditioning system and central heating unit removes the need for a separate furnace inside your home.<p>
<p>A specific air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
