<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Blanchard OK</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
