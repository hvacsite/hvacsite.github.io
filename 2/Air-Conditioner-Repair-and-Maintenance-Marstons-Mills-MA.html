<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
