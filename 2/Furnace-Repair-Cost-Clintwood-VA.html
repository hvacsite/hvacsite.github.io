<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
