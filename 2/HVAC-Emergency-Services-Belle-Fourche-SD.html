Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the professionals believed they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
