<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by many public water materials, it has actually been found in well water. If you've evaluated the air in your house and found a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
