<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
