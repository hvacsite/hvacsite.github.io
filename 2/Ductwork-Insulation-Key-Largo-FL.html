This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
