<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in King George VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
