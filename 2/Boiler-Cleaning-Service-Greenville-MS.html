These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season.

POLICE rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect.

No extra charge.<p>
