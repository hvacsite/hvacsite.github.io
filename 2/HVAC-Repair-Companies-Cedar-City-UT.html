<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Cedar City UT</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to purchase it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually met in a very long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
