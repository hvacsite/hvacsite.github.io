Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space a/c offers optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
