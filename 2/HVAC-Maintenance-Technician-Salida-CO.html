<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>

In other words, in-floor heater supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
