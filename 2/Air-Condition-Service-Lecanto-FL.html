<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
