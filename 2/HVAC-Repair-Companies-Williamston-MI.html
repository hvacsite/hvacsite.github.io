However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
