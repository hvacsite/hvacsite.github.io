<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Youngsville NC?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
