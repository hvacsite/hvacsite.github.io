<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced.

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
