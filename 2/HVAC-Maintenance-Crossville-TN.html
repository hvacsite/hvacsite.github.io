He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
