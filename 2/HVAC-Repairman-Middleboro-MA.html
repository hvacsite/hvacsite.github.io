Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
