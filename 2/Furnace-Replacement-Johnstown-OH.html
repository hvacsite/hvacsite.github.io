<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978.

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
