<p>When service is less chaotic, it can be the perfect time to brainstorm innovative techniques for promoting your HVAC company as well.

If the experiments settle, you can formalize them as part of the marketing method you describe in next year's business plan.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the type of electrical power. The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
