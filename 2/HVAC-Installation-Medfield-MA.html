<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
