<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system appears less like a high-end item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a major renovation job, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant flooring heater is an appropriate solution for your specific house heating requirements.<p>
