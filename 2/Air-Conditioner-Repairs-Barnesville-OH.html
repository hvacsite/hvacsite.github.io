<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore in Barnesville OH</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an ac system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
