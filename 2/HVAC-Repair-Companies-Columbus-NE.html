<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
