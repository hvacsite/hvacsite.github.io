<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transfer the heat to the rooms. Most modern warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
