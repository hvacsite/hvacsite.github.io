<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.
