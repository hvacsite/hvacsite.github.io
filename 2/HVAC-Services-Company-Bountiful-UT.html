<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
