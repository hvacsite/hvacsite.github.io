<p>Simplify your services, earn more services earnings, and supply a fantastic consumer experience.

This step is vital so the system isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
