According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins.

Compare the various furnace effectiveness scores advised by the individual contractors to pick the model and system that best fits your energy requires.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
