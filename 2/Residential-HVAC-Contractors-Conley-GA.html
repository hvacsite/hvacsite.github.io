Such info can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
