<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal components also. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces at the same time, however are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house.
