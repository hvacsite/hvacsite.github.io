<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd problem that sometimes turns up. It is very essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do discover your furnace acting oddly. The faster you react to issues with your furnace, the simpler they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the issue worse, and typically more costly.<p>
