<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
