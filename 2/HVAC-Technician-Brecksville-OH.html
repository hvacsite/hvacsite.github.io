<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
