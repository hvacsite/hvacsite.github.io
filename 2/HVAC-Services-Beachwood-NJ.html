<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has determined building products, home furnishings, and mold as major issues, however much of the danger likewise comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big issue in the establishing world.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
