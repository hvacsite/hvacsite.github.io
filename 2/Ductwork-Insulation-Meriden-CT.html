<p>As a NECESSARY SERVICES BUSINESS, we remain Readily available and open to help with any of your pipes, drain, heating, a/c or electrical requirements. However, in the United States, as in other countries, regulatory progress mainly stops at the doorway. This is not to state that there aren't requirements for levels of CO and NO2; lots of bodies have set requirements and guidelines for both In the United States, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA) have actually set CO standards, however the EPA's standards just use to outdoor air. OSHA, NIOSH and others have actually set NO2 standards, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has set standards for both-- including for indoor air.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
