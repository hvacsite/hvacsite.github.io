<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Since resistance differs considerably from individual to individual, it is not practical to design a universal guideline fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a ten years research study examining more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 ecological samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. The majority of samples evaluated were tested favorable for germs and fungi.<p>
