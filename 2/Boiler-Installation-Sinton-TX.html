Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
