<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried.
