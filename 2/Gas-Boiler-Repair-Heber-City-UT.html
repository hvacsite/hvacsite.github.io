<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
