<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
