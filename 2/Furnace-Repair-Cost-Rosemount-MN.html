<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
