<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Even if you don't feel unclean, pollen clings to your hair and clothes where it can easily irritate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air contamination. Don't have time for a fast rinse? A minimum of wash your hands to remove lingering pollen, specifically prior to reaching food or your face, recommends the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>
