<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is normally acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
