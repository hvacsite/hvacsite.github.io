<p>There are two main forms of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.
