<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers during summers. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned completely before colder seasons begin.

<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in Beltsville Maryland</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's an easy problem like particles clogging the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing new equipment.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins produced by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels.

Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven.

The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.
