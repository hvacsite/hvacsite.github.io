<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>During typical furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can develop on internal elements. Airborne components from regular home products and surface areas can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC devices. Left untreated, these issues can result in loss of performance and worse, breakdown of element materials and a much shorter furnace lifespan In time, essential components like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin wearing away, leading to minimized efficiency.<p>
<p>Outside pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
