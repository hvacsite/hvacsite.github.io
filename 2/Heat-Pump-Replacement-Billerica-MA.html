<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Billerica MA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house building is to minimize air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
