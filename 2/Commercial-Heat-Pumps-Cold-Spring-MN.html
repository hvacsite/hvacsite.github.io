<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
