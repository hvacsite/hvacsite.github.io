<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as various as the different houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, homes, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, sufficient air circulation (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
