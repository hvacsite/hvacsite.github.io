<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
