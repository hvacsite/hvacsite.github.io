<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
