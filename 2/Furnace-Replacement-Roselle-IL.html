<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
