<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
