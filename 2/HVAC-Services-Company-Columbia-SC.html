<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
