Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.

<p>A health questionnaire need to be established and dispersed to all worried workers. Such a tool should identify the number of people affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they lie within the office; indicate when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health signs or health problems; identify all machines run in the work environment; suggest the kind of outside air pollution; and determine potential sources of job stress.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not usually consist of lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from household pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more intricate problems-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the three methods below may be proper.<p>
