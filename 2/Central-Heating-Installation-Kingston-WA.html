<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
