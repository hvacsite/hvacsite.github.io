<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new building.
