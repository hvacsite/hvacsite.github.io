<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>You might upgrade to the greatest performance equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days.
