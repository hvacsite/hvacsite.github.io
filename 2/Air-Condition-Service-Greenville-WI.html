<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Greenville WI?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
