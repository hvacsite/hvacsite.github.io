<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, including polluted soil tracked within, and usage of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>A radiator is the part of your car that keeps the engine cool and protects it from excessive heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to stay clean - constantly. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits develop inside your automobile's radiator. These make the cooling system become blocked and less reliable. This in effect injures your lorry's efficiency. A routine radiator flush is enough to keep the system in shape. For this reason, make radiator flushing a part of your regular cars and truck maintenance schedule. For all your radiator flush requirements, call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
