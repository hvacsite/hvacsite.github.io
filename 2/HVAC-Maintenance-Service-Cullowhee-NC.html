<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an a/c, there are a few things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system won't have the ability to cool your house effectively. When shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each option can and will considerably affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
