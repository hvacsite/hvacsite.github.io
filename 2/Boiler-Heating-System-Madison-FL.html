<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., office devices; furnishings, wall and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Annual furnace maintenance is the best method to keep your heater working safely and effectively. That's why we offer our special Convenience First Membership that makes preventive care easy and budget-friendly. Ask us about our maintenance program that can conserve you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Due to the fact that when you look after your furnace, it will take care of you with lower energy bills, less repairs, and more years of convenience.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically vital to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this data may recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
