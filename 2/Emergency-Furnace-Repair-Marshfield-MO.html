<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service.

Take time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
