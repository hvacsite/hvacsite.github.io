<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Brooklyn NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank.

We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
