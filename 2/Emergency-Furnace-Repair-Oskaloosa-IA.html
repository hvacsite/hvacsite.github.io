This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
