<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
