<p>While contaminant levels from private sources may not pose a considerable health risk by themselves, many homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to minimize the danger from existing sources and to avoid new issues from happening. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other toxins that can not only unclean up the air, however cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
