<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main issue in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has carried out. Examinations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the same to be real. These investigations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
