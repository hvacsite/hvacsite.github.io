These treatments vary from advanced tracer gas methods used predominantly in building research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be utilized by building operators.

The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has resulted in the advancement of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)
