<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation business entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Because they just partially get rid of the radon decay items and do not reduce the amount of radon getting in the home, the efficiency of these devices is unpredictable. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a reputable means of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional information on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>If you believe there is a health issue associated to the indoor environment, please schedule a consultation for a medical examination at the University Employee Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119. At this time, you will be asked to complete the Ask for Indoor Air Quality Examination form (discovered in the Indoor Air Quality Policy). When finishing the request that you supply as much detail as possible for the EHS Responder, please send and finish the form via e-mail or fax It is important.<p>
