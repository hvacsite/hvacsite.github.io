<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
