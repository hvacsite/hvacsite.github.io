<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to consider. Many times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system.
