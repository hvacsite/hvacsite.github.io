<p>Many family products release organic vapors that can cause unfavorable health effects. These effects may include nose and throat irritation, headaches, dizziness, and queasiness. Products including these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, hobby supplies, deodorizers, cleaners, and disinfectants. Formaldehyde is another natural vapor that can trigger similar symptoms. Formaldehyde can be discovered in new building and construction products, such as plywood, particle, fiberboard, and paneling board, and in cigarette smoke and lots of customer items.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
