<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
