Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what deal with a home may cost. Just recently I required to contact these men two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
