Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
