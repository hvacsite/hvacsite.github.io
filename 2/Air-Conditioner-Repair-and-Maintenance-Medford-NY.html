This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
