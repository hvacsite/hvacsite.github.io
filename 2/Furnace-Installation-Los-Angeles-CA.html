<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been effectively dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
