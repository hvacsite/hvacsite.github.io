<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
