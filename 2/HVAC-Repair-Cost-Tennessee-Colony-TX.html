<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>
