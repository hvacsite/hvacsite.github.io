What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
