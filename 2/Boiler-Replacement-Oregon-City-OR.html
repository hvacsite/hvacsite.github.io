Environment Pro is trusted and genuinely appreciated us and our scenario. We came home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover somebody to help us right prior to a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my friends.<p>

<h3>Solar Heating System in Oregon City Oregon</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Once installed, underfloor heating requires virtually no maintenance and includes a 30 Year Warranty for total assurance.

<p>We have been exceptionally delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked extremely well and is so effective that it considerably lowered our utility expenses - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergency situations they responded rapidly and resolved the problem.<p>
