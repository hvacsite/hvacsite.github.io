<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
