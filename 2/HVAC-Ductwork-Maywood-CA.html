<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Maywood CA?</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
