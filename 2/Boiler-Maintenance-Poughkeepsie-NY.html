<p>Indoor temperatures are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
