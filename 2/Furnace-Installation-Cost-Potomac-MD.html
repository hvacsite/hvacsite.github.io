<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Potomac MD Home</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I should state it does the job quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool off your house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
