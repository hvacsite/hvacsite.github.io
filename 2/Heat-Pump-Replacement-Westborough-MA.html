<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous people.<p>
