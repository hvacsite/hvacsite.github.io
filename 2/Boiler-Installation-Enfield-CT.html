<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is computed using the very same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The average summertime temperature level to reach the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to come to the correct SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling units produced in the United States.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
