<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Weymouth MA 02188</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
