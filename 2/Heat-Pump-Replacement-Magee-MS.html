<p>Specific instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often hard to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to take note of the time and location signs take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the location, for example, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning unit and heatpump need to be free of all blockages and debris. Obstructions can obstruct the flow of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess moisture can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, uneven temperature regulation, bacteria, and compromised air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess wetness streams away from the system.<p>
