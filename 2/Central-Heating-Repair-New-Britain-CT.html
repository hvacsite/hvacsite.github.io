Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Simply adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioning unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>A split ac system includes 2 primary parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided a/c unit count on a set of pipes to connect the outside to the within air system which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split air conditioner installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to produce either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
