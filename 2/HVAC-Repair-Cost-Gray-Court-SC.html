<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
