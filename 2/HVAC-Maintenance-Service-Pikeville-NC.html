<p>Indoor air contamination is caused by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can differ considerably from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance task might require completely different actions and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected. Installations can also vary considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In some cases, entirely new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than models made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>
