According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature level.

However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to call in an expert to repair the unit and inspect.<p>
