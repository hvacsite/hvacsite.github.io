<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., office devices; flooring, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new furnaces can heat your home. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
