<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered.
