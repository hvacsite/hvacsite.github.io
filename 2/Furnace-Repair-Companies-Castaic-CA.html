<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
