<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
