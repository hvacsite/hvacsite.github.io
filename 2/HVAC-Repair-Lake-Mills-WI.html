<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the professionals thought they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
