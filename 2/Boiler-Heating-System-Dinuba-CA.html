<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the concern and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Often a temporary indoor air quality issue is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complicated issues-- recognized by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods listed below may be appropriate.<p>
