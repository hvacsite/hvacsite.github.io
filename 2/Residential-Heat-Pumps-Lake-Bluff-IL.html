<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality problem is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complicated problems-- determined by regularly undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics below might be appropriate.<p>
