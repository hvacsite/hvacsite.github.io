<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Gary IN?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
