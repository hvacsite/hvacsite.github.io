<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
