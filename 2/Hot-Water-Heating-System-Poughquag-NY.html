However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
