<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
