<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
