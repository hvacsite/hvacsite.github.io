<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
