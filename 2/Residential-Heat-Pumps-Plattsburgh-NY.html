<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
