<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractors in South Windsor</h2>

<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use.

Heating systems that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively.
