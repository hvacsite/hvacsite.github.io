<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps ought to also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.)

<p>Mobile homes are generally smaller than stick-built homes and utilize considerably less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
