<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
