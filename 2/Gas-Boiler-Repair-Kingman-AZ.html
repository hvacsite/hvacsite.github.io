<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
