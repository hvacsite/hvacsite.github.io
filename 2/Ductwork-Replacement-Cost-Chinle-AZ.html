<p>Professional heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new.

Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
