<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Mercedes TX?</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I proceeded and bought this Provider and I must state it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool down the house which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
