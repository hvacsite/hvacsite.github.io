"Humidifier fever" is a typical illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the professionals thought they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
