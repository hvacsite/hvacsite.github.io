The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
