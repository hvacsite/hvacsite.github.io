<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
