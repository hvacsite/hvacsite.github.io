<p>Improve your services, make more services profits, and supply an incredible consumer experience. To ensure the system you select is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to figure out the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the very same size unit you presently have. These computations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
