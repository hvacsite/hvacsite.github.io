Signs that can suggest your home may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To spot smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>

Review of this information may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, monitoring information might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
