As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
