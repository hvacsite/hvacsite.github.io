<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
