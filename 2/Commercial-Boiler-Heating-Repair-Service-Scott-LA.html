Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
