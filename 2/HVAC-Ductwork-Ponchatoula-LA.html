<h3>Central Heating Repair in Ponchatoula LA 70454</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems feature a variety of special functions that can further enhance efficiency and performance. For instance, property owners might wish to try to find one that includes a built-in filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to minimize energy expenses much more. Of course, more functions indicate greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
