<p>Details offered in this security guide is based upon current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures continuously evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly engaging, and this interaction leads to changes in each.
