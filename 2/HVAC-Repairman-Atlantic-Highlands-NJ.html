<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
