<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Basically, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

Installing a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is protected inside. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
