<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Sunnyvale CA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
