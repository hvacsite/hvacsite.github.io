It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
