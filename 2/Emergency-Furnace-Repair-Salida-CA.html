<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
