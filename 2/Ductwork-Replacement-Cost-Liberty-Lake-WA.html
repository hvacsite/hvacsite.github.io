<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is essential to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
