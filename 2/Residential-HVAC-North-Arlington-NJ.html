<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
