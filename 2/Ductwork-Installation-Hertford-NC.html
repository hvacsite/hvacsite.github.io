<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
