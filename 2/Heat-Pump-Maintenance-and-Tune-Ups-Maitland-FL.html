<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Maitland FL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
