<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Naperville IL</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
