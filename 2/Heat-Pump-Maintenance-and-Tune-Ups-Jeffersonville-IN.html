<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
