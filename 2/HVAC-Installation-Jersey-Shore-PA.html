<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
