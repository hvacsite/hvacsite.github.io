The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
