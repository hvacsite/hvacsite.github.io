<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
