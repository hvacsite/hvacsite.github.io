<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
