<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical method of reducing exposure to indoor air toxins, also will lower but not remove direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking cigarettes produces such large amounts of pollutants, mechanical or natural ventilation strategies do not remove them from the air in your home as rapidly as they build up. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it takes to significantly lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs significantly. Consequently, the most effective way to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking there.<p>
