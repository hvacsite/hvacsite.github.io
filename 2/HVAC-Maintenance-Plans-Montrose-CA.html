<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you have to do it often, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
