<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Hartland WI</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, introduces outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
