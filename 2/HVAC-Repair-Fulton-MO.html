Combustion products from vehicle exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, space heating systems, scented candle lights, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products might result in throat, eye, and nose inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
