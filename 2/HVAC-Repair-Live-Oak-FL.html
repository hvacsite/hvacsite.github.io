<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
