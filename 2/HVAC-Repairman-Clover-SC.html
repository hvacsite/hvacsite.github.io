<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
