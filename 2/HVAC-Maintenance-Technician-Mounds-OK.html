<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building."

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
