<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
