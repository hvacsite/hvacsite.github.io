<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
