<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless splits enable you to prevent the need for a full duct system like the majority of other cooling systems need. You will also delight in a much more flexible system in regards to installation and cost. And since each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when one person would choose it a little warmer in a different space.<p>
