<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Maywood IL</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
