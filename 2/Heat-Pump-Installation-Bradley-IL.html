My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for lowering the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers.

<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air.
