<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
