<p>Air conditioners can produce a great deal of water because they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
