<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
