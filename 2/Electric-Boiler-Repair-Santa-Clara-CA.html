<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
