Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense.
