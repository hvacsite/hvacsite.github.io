<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
