<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Providence RI Home Owners</h3>

The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>

R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
