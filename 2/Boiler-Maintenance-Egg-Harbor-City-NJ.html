Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
