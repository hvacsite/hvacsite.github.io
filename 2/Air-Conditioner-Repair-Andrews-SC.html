<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Andrews SC?</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is dirty or stopped up Prior to trying to fix any issue, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
