<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Westfield IN</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
