<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
