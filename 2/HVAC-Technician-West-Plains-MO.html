<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
