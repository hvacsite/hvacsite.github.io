<h3>Home AC Repair in Bloomingdale Illinois</h3>
<p>If your a/c unit is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple problem like particles clogging the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.

The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
