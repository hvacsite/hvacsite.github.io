Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
