<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Mission Hills CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

We'll visit your house for a comprehensive inspection, including an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to find the best system for your house.
