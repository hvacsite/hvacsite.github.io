<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
