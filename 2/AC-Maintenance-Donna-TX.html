<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at reasonable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor. As with measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, identifying the proper size of system for your house likewise depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>For example, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate sufficient quantities of outdoor air.

Improperly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
