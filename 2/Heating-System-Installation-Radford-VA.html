<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
