<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
