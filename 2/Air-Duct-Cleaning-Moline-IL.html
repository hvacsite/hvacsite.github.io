<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Moline IL</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
