<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit.
