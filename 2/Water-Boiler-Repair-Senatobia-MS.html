<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>

Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might end up being clogged up, reducing air flow circulation, quality, and volume.
