<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
