<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to flow hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat moved heat to other articles in the spaces, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't think enough about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
