<p>In homes, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products produced indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are many other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
