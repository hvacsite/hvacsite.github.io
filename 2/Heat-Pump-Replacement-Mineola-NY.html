There can be a severe risk from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that most people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to avoid new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you choose whether to do something about it that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
