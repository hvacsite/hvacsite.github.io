<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to examine building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas methods used primarily in constructing research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by constructing operators. NIST scientists are continuously developing brand-new test treatments, and then demonstrating them in the field to examine their feasibility and dependability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has led to the advancement of a crucial database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>

<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
