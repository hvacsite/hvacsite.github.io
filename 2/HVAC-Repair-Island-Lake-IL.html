We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks.
