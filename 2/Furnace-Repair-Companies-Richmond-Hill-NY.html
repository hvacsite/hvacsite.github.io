<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again.
