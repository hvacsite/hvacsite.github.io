<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
