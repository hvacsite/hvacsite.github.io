<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
