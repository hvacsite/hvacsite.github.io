ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
