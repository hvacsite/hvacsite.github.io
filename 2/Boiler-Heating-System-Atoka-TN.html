<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the pollutant source away from residents or perhaps transferring prone residents.<p>

<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Atoka TN</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general task provision" uses. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, specifies that a company should offer a healthy and safe office. Therefore, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
