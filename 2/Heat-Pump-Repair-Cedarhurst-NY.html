<p>We take a look at hints before we offer advice to change instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy.

It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
