<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne.
