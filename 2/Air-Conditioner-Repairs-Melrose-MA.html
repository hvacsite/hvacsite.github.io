<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
