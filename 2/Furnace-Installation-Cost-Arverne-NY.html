Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair.
