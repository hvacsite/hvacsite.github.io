<h3>AC Compressor in Bridgeton MO 63044</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the problem and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
