<p>Central air systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators.
