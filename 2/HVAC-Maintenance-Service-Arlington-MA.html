<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
