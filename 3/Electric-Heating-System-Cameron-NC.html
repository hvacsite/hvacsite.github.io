Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
