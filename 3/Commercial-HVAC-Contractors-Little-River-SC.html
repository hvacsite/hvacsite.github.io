<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
