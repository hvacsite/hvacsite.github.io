To make sure the unit you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to identify the precise type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
