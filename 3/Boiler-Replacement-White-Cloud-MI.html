"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.
