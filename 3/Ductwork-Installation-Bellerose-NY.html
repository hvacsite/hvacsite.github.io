<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Bellerose NY</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
