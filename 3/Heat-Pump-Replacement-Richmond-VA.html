<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
