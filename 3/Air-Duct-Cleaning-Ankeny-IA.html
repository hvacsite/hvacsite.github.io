Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
