<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
