<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
