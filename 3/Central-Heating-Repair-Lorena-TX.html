<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
