<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
