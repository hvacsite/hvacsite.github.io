As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below.
