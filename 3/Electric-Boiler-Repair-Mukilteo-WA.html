<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter.

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
