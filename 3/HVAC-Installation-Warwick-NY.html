<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
