<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
