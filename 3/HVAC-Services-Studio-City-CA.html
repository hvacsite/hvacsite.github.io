<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
