Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
