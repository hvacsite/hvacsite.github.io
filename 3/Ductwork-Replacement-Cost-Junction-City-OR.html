<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are many actions a property owner can take to choose products that will prevent indoor air issues from happening - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider utilizing strong wood products. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
