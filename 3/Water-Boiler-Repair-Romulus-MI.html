<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats.
