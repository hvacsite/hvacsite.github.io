<p>The most underrated HVAC component in your air conditioning system is the evaporator & condenser coil. When making a huge HVAC decision on replacing your equipment, the majority of people think the compressor is the only part that matters. A lot of air conditioning replacements take place when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. When the copper or aluminum coils start to rust, refrigerant leakages happen.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
