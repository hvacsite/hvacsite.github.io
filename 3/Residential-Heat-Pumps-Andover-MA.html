They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Radiant heating unit don't use ducts, that makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They likewise do not produce cold and hot areas. All of the heat that radiant heating systems disperse moves through strong objects, keeping the heat near the flooring of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat spaces with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, given that a lot of floors tend to retain heat better than air does.<p>
