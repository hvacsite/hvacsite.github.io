<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and situated ways we might have more even heat. He included these substantial but small changes in his quote. Because of current warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>Radiant heating unit don't use ducts, that makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They likewise do not produce cold and hot areas. All of the heat that radiant heating systems disperse moves through strong objects, keeping the heat near the flooring of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat spaces with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, given that a lot of floors tend to retain heat better than air does.<p>
