<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, vehicles such as vehicles, trains, submarines, planes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
