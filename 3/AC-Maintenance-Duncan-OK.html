Luckily, there are actions that many people can take both to lower the danger from existing sources and to prevent new problems from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
