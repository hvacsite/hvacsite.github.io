<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Invest in education and training: HVAC is not "general rule" work, and no 2 homes are the same. When technicians are effectively trained, they pick and install effective, safe equipment. They understand what it means to offer top-notch craftsmanship, and they get fewer callbacks from dissatisfied clients. Supervisors and founders must also remain abreast of progressing technologies and market finest practices.<p>
