<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
