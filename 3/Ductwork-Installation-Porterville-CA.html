<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
