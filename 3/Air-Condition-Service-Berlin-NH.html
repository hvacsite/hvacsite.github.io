<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
