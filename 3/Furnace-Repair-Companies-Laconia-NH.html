<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often might be because of an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
