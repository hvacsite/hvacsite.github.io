<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Fairfax VA 22030</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it is very important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
