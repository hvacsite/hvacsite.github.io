<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
