<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Central Falls Rhode Island</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
