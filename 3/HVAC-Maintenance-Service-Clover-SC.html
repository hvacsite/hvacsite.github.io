<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants.

The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
