<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Westlake Village CA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have satisfied in a long period of time.

Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
