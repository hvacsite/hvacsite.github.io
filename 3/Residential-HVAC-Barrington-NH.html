<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
