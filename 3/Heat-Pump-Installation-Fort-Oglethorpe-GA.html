<h3>Electric Heating in Fort Oglethorpe GA 30742</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is secured inside your home. When it does require to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
