Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
