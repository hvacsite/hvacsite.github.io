<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning items, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside contaminants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
