<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
