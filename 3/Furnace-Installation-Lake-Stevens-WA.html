<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Lake Stevens WA</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally occur. In many cases, the belt is improperly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
