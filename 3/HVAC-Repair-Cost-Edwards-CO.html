For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air course. A standard ac system transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
