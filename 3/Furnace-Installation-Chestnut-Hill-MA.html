<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.

<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Chestnut Hill MA 02467</h3>
<p>It can be the best time to conceptualize imaginative techniques for promoting your HVAC company as well when service is less busy. For example, you may try taking part in home and garden shows, trade convention or other kinds of event marketing. Or maybe you'll introduce a contest, a giveaway or a special funding arrangement to enhance equipment sales. If the experiments pay off, you can formalize them as part of the marketing technique you detail in next year's business plan.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
