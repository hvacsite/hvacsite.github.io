<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in New Castle IN 47362</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
