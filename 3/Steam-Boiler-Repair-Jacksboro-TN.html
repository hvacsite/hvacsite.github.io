<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
