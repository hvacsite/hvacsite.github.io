<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
