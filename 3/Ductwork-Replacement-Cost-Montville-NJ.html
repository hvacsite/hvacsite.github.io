Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
