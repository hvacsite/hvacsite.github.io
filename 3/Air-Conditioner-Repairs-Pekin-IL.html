<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
