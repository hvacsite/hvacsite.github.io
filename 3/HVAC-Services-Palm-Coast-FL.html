<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing.

When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
