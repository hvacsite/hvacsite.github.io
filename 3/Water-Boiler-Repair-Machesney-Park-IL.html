<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Machesney Park IL</h3>

Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.
