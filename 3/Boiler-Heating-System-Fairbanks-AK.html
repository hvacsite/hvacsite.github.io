<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently higher incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or merely a high level of competitors for proficient trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average wages for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
