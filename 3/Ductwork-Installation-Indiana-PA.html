<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives usually total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (houses generally utilize in between one and five heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
