<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There are some more serious threats for HVAC workers that could be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be harmful. As HVAC service technicians frequently enter into contact with electrical wiring, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other types of burns and abrasions to the skin. Although there are threats related to the job, it is typically performed safely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
