<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
