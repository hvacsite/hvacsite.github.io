<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
