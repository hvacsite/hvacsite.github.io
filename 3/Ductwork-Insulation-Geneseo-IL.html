<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Geneseo IL</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor toxins given off by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
