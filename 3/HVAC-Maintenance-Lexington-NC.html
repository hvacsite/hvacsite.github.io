<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
