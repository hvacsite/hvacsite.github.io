<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
