<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
