<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
