<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
