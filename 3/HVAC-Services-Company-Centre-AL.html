<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
