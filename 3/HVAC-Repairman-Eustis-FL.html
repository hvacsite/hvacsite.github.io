<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
