<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
