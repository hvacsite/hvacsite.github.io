<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust.

Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>

Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
