<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are offered to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Support! Environment Pro is trusted and truly cared about us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
