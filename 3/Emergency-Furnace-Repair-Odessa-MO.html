<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Odessa MO Home Owners</h3>

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Stopped up gutters can lead to water permeating into your house, causing mold development, according to the EPA.

Next time it rains, inspect your gutters. If you see water leaking out of end caps, flowing on the outdoors, or leaking behind them, it's time to get out the ladder.<p>
