<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
