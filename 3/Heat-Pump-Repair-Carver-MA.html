<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
