They weren't cheap but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
