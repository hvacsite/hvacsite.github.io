<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
