<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
