<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically greater than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the design you purchase.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
