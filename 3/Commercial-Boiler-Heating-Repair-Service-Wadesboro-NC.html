<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
