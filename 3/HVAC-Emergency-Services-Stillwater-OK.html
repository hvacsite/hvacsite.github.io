<p>Enhance your services, earn more services income, and provide an incredible consumer experience. To make certain the unit you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation quote to figure out the precise type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have. These computations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is important so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>We're committed to helping you enjoy the best returns from your a/c unit and heat financial investment. Sign up for a maintenance agreement so that you never forget a tune-up. Routine maintenance produces much better cooling and heating, improves energy efficiency, and prevents premature breakdowns. We also offer funding on approved credit when you need to upgrade your home with new installations.<p>

There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Simply a few years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have been lots of long, dry, hot streaks since then.

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Stillwater OK</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
