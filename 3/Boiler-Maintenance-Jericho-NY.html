<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, smoking cigarettes, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made items. For instance, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
