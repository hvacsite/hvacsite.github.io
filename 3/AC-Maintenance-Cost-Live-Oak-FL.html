<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
