<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high expenses. Furnaces often lose their efficiency as they age, especially if they have actually not been appropriately kept.

And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies each month might be used to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a substantial difference.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
