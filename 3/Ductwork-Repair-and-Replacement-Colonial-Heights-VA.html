<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at reasonable energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your house also depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>
