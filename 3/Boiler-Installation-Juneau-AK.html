<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Juneau AK</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once removing waste gases and particulates.

Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it significantly tough for your lungs to function correctly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
