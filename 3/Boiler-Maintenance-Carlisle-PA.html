<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, volatile natural compounds ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause adverse health conditions.

<p>Considering that heating and cooling work might also require setting up or repairing plumbing to supply oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor might also be required to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumbing technician on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this type of work. When getting an estimate, make sure to ask not just if a company is certified, but also what type of license it holds.<p>

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
