What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
