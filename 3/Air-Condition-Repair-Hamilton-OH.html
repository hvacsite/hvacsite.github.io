<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
