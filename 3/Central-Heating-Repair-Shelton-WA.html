<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Shelton WA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
