<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Littlerock CA</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans need to be set up in all kitchen areas and restrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are durable and quiet. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to make sure the fans run for an adequate time period. An excellent guideline is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
