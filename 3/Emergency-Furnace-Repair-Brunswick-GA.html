<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
