<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
