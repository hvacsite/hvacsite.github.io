<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about potential results of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.
