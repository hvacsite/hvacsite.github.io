Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
