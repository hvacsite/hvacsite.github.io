<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
