<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to lower the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can reduce the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as gas, oil, or coal. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal cooling and heating system uses considerably less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heater an appealing solution to cut your carbon footprint, providing a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a vehicle radiator or normal family a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
