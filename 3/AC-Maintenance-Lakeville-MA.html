The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Lots of aspects impact IAQ.
