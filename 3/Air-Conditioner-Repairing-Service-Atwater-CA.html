While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak efficiency.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
