<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
