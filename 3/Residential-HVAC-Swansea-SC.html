<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty.

There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Swansea SC 29160</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.
