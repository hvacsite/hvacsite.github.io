<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Elizabeth CO</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
