<h3>Boiler Heating System in Havre De Grace MD 21078</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
