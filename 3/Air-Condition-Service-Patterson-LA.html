<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly decreases exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a brand-new gas stove or variety, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continually. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
