A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several spaces with one external system.

<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a method that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can also generate air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
