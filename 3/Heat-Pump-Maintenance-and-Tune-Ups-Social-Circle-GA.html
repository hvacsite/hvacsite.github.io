However, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

It's a framework to direct the launch or revamp of your business that you can build on and restructure as business develops.<p>
