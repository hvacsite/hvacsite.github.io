<p>Due to the fact that a project such as this is going to require a rather comprehensive amount of work it is advised that a homeowner demand a number of estimates from a range of contractors. The best times of the year to do such a task are in the months in which homes are not utilizing their heating systems.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
