<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the difficulty location in examining the expense. He dealt with the problem in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I thought about fair before he called back, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not occur again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
