<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
