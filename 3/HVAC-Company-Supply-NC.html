<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
