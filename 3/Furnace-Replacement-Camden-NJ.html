<p>Bear in mind that the SEER score is calculated using the same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summer temperature to arrive at the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the proper SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling units made in the United States.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A great place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>It's too late to start wondering about whether or not to call an AC repairman once summer season brings the heat.
