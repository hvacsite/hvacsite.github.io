<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
