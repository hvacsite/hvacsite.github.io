<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
