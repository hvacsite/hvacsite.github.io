<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and houses matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
