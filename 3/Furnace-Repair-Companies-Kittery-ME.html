<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
