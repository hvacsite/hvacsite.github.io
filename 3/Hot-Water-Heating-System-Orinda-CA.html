<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>

Nevertheless, presuming they are installed correctly and correctly looked after, the probability of them having issues is little.<p>
