If it blows again, call a pro-- you have actually got more serious problems.<p>

Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months.

Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

According to the marketplace research study firm Statista, household penetration in the U.S. clever home market is already at 33 percent and is anticipated to reach 54 percent by 2023.
