<h3>Benefits of Professional AC Repair in Iva SC</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and trouble in breathing in some people exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might activate attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has likewise been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
