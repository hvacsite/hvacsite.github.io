<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
