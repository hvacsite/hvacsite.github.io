<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you may try to find a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
