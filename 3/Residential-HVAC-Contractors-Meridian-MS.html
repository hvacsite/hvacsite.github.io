<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes set up under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
