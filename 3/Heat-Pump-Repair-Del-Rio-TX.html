<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
