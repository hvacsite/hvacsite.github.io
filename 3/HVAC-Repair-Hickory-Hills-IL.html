<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
