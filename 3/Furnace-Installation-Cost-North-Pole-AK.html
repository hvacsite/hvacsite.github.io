<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically develop in ductwork, limiting airflow.

Ought to you experience any of these, air out your home, open a window to the furnace space and immediately call a service technician.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
