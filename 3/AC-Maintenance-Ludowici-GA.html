<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
