In some cases, the acquisition supplies a method for the seller to retire and make sure workers are taken care of. For the most part, the obtaining companies desire the owner to remain. Reedy prefers the owners remain on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
