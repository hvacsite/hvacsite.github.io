<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building and construction (homes generally use between one and five heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
