<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may notice musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
