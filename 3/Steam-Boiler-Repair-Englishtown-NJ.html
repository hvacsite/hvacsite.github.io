<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
