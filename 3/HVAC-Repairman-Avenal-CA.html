<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these devices doubts since they only partly remove the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon entering the home.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies more details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
