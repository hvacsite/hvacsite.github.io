<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Pittsburg CA?</h3>
<p>We are service specialists! As certified contractors and specialists in the field of heating and air-conditioning, we have the tools, the equipment, and the experience to keep your equipment running efficiently all year long.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
