Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch contaminants more or less continuously.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
