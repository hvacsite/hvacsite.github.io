<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the problem. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
