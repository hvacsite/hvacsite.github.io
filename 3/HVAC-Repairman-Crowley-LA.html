<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit honest, pleasant and responsive. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was extraordinary, handy and informative - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were courteous and conscientious. The work site was left entirely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
