No matter what the kind of house HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is running safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners feature a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control board, which determines the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil.
