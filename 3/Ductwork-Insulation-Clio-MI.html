<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Clio MI</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Room a/c unit feature a thermostat sensing unit, situated behind the control board, which measures the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. If the sensor is knocked out of position, the air conditioning system could cycle continuously or act unpredictably. The sensor should be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
