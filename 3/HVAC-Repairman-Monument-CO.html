<p>Oil heating systems are typically not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not accomplish an effectiveness greater than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
