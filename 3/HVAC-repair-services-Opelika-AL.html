<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Opelika AL Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
