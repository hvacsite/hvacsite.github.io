<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can collect and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these diseases do not show up till many years after exposure started. Many people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothing and devices brought home from task websites.<p>

<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends on individual sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
