<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
