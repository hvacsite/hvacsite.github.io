<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>While contaminants typically found in indoor air are responsible for numerous damaging impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems.

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
