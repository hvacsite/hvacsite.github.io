<p>The icing issue ends up being much more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from a business or seller to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the air conditioning system. A voided service warranty will not do you any good must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and employ a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
