<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
