<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
