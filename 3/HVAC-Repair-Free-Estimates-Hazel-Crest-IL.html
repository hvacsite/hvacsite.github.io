<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
