<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Fairless Hills PA</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is unclean or clogged Before attempting to repair any problem, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. Get in touch with a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
