<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in big commercial buildings can not be efficiently recognized or corrected without an extensive structure examination. These investigations might begin with composed questionnaires and telephone assessments in which structure detectives assess the history of occupant signs and building operation procedures. In some cases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
