<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
