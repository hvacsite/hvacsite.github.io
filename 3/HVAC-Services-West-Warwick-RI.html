<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
