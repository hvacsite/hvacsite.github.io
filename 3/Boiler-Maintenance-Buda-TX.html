Taylor took sufficient time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings.

In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially.
