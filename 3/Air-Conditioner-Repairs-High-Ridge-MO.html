<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
