<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
