<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.
