<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
