<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance.
