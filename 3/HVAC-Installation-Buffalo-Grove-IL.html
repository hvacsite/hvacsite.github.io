<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Buffalo Grove IL</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors might trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
