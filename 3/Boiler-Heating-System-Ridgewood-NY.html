In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on.
