<h3>Central Heating Installation in Kerrville TX 78028</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
