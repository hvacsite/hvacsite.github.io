<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Heating is likewise one of the greatest energy consumers in your home, so homeowners who may be purchasing a new furnace should thinking about changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to conserve cash and help the environment.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
