<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Salem OH</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
