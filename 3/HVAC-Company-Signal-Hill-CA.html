<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>We advise using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a really effective thermal barrier.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
