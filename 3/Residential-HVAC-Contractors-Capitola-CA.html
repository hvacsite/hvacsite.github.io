<p>Consumer items that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can cause signs associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly read the labels including health threat info and warns on the appropriate usage of these products. Use items which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors just if the area is well ventilated.<p>
<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the results kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too restricted to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts might happen.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a house heating system, you might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
