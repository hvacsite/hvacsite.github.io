An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter.
