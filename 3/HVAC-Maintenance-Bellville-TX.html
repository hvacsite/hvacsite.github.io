<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
