<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
