<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Solana Beach CA 92075</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any airflow restriction will reduce the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Heating is also one of the greatest energy consumers in your house, so homeowners who might be buying a new furnace should considering replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient model to save cash and help the environment. The average furnace lasts between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a substantial investment in your house. Invest carefully by finding out as much as you can about available alternatives.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild results that are often mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, disorientation and queasiness. The results of CO exposure can differ greatly from individual to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
