<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
