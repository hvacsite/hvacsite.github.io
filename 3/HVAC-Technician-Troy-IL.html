<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Turn off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
