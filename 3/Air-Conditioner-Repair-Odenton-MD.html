<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
