<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>Homes can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes due to the fact that much of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure materials, home furnishings, and household products, are comparable.
