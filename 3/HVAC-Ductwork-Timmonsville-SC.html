<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Because cooling and heating work might also require repairing or installing plumbing to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor may also be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumbing technician on call.

When getting a price quote, make certain to ask not only if a company is accredited, however also what type of license it holds.<p>
