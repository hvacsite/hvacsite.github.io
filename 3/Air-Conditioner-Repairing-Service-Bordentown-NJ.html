<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Bordentown NJ Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological contaminants are damp or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
