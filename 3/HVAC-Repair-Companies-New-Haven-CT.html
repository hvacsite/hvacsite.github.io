<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a very helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
