<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Winchendon MA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and extremely well-informed. Expenses are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was obviously sensible.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
