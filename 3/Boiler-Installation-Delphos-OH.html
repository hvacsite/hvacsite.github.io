<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Delphos OH</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air unit. In fact, you can even DIY, despite our strong suggestion not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air conditioning. Furthermore, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional products and equipment.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
