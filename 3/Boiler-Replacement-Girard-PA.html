<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and uncomplicated approach to minimize ambient air contamination and potential health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
