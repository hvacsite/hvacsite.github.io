CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Bogart GA 30622</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to examine circumstance & decided to go with them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were very expert, considerate and the work was really effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heating systems can heat your home. Honestly, our home heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
