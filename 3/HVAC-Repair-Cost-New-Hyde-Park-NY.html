<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
