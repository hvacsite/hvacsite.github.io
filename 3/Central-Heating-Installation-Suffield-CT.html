<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
