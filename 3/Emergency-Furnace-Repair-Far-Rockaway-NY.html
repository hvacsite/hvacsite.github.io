He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
