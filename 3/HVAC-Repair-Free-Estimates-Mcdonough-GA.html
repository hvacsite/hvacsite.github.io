<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Mcdonough GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
