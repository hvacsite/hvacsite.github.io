<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
