<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
