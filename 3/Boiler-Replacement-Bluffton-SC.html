<h3>Facts All Bluffton SC Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Companies are needed to follow the General Duty Stipulation of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply employees with a safe office that does not have any known dangers that trigger or are likely to cause death or serious injury. The OSHAct also requires companies to comply with occupational safety and health standards developed under it. Employers should be fairly aware of the possible sources of poor air quality, and they must have the resources essential to recognize and control workplace threats. It is also their responsibility to inform employees of the immediate threats that are present.Specific state and local regulations might apply.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
