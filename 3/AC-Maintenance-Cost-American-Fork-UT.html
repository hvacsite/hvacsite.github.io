<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in American Fork UT</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
