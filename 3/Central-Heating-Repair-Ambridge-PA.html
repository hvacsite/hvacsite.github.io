<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
