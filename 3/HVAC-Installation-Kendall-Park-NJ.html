<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, because it considers not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
