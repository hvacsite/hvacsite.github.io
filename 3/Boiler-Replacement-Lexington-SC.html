<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)
