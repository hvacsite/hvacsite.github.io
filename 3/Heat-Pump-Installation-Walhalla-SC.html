<p>A geothermal desuperheater is helpful and really effective, particularly during the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's house. This is because the excess heat absorbed from within the house is carried out into the hot water tank rather than being sent back into the earth. The result, therefore, is totally free hot water! Moreover, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water along with its primary purpose of supplying area heating. This means that cost savings are still recognized during the cooler duration. In reality, a desuperheater reduces winter season water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>

<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Walhalla SC HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
