<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time.

In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
