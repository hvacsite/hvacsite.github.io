<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
