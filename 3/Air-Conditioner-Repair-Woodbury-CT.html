From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
