<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
