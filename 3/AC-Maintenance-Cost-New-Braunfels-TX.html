<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
