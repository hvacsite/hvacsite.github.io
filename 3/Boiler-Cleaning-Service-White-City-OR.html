<p>There are two main forms of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating business.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
