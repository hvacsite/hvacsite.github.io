<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, family pet hair and other particles lead to problems like failure to provide adequate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.
