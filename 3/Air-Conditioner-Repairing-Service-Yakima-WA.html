<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
