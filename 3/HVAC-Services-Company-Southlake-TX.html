<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied fantastic client service at the end of the consultation by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>

She didn't need a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
