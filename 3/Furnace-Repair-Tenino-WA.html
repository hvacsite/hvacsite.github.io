This type of air conditioning system also is utilized in little commercial buildings.

<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the general indoor air quality meets a specific standard. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and safety guidelines and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to prevent illness or certain impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial situations.

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
