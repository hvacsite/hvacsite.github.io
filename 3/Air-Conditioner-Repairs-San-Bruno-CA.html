During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
