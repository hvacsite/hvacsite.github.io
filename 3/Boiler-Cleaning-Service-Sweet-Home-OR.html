<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary price of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (houses usually utilize in between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load.
