In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
