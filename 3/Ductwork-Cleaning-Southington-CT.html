<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
