<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electrical energy, a heat pump is an economical solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioning unit stops working, start by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts.
