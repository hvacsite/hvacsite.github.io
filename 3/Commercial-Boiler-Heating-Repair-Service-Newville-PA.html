<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace 2 furnaces in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch toxins more or less continually.

Malfunctioning or unvented devices or incorrectly utilized products can release higher and sometimes hazardous levels of toxins inside your home.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned up if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running. Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's an excellent early treatment to try. Plan to do this on a fairly warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins.

<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part.
