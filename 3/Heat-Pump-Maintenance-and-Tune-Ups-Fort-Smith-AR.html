<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part.
