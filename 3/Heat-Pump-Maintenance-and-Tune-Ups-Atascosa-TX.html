<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
