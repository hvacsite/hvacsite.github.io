<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
