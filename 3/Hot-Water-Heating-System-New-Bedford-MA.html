However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.

<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
