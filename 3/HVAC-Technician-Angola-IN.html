<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heater.

Forced air heater tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output. Required air heating systems also tend to create hot and cold areas throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air rises to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
