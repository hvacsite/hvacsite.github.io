In North America, divided systems are frequently seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in little commercial buildings.

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Contractors in Stevensville MD 21666</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly greater earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical incomes for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
