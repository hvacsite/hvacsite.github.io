Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.
