<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Annandale VA 22003</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Most trustworthy HVAC technicians will offer free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to provide you a totally free quote over the phone, as it might not properly reflect what they will find once they have a look at the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost price quote, that quantity will usually be applied towards your balance due, must you decide to employ that contractor.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
