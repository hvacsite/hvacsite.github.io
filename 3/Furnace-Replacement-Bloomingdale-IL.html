<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may end up being clogged, minimizing air flow volume, distribution, and quality. They also may end up being places for molds and bacteria to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be correctly maintained to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
