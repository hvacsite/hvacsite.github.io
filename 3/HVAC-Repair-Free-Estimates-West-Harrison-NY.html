<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
