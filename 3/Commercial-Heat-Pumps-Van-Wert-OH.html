<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
