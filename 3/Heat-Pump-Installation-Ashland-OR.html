<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight.
