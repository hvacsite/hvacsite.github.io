<p>A geothermal desuperheater is beneficial and extremely effective, specifically during the Summer while the system acts to cool one's home.

This indicates that cost savings are still realized during the colder duration. In truth, a desuperheater minimizes winter season water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>
