<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%.

Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it considers not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
