<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leak in the attic.
