<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
