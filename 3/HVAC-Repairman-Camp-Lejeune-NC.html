<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
