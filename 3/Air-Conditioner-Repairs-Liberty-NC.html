<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside your home is related to a greater frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
