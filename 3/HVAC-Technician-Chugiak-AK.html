Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
