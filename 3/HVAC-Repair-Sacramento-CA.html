<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
