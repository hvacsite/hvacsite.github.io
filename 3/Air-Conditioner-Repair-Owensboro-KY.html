The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.
