<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
