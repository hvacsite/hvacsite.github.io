<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or common household air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and fragrances, contribute to indoor air pollution and have actually been known to asthma signs in sensitive individuals.
