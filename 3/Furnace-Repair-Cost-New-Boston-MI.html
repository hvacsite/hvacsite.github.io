<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Think about possible impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, particularly instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
