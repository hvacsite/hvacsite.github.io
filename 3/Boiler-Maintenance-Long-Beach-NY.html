<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
