<p>Similar to the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary extensively based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
