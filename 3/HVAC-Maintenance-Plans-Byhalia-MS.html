<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
