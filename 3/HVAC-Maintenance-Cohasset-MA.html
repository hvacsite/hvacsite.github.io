<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC company owner need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
