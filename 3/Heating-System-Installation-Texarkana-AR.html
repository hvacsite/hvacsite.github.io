<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a threat only when they are handled in such a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for substantial health issue.<p>
