In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.
