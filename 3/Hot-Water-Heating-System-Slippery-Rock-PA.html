<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to assess and, if required, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same duration. Basically, SEER provides more information based on how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the system's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
