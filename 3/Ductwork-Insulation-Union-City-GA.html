<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
