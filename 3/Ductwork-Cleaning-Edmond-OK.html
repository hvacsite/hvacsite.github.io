<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Edmond OK</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants produced by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in many buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Clogged up rain gutters can result in water permeating into the house, causing mold growth, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow practically anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your house. Direct exposure to high levels of family mold may set off mold allergic reaction symptoms. Next time it rains, check your seamless gutters. If you see water leaking out of end caps, streaming on the outside, or dripping behind them, it's time to go out the ladder.<p>
