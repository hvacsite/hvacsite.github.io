<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
