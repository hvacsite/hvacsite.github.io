<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video footage. They use a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the space. The bigger the space, the more effective the home heating unit needs to be.
