<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Poteet</h2>

Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
