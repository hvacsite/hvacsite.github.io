<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He got along, uncomplicated and a thoroughly enjoyable individual to have around that entire time. His time and know-how to RESOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send out the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
