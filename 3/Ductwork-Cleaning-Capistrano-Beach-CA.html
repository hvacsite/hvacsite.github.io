The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
