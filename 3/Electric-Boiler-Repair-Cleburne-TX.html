<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
