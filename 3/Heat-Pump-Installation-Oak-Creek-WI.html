<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
