<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
