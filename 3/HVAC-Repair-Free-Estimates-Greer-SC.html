<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
