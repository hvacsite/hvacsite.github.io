<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
