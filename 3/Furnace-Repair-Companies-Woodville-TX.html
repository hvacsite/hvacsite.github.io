<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Woodville TX 75979</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I enjoy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were really professional, polite and the work was very effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
