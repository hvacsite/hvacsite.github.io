<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
