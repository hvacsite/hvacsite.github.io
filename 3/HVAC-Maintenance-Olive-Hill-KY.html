<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
