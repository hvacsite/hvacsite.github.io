<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge contaminants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>As discussed above, activating your brand-new under tile floor heating unit too soon, prior to the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere effectively, and may void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the substance had cured. If you do not follow their instructions, and mortar producers might refuse service warranty protection.<p>
