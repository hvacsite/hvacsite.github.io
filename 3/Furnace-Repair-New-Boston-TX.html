For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
