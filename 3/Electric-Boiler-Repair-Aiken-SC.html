<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion objective.
