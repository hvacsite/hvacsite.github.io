My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
