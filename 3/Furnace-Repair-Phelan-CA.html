<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health results discussed.

Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed results could happen.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may notice unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
