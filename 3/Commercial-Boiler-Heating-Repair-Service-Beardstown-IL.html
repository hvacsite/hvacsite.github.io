<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
