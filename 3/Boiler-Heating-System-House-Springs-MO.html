<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can typically be performed in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
