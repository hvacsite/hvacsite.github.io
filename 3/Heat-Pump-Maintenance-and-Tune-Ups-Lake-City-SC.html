It takes very little time to heat up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
