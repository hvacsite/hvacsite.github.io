<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
