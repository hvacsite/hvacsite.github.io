<p>Professional heating system setups. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these firms offer chances they can't attain by themselves. A lot of owners stick with the larger firms after acquisition.

Reedy prefers the owners stay on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
