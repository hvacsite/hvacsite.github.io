Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
