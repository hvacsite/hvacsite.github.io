<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
