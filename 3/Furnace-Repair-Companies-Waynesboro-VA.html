<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological pollutants are damp or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.
