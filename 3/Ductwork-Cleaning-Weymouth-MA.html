<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Most of the time they were at first interested in from another location keeping track of some other element of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't up until later, as they continued working with us, that they found out about and implemented indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a much healthier, safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable repercussions associated with indoor air toxins.<p>
