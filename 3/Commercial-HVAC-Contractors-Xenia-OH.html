<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
