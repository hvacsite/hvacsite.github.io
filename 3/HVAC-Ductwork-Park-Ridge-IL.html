<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
