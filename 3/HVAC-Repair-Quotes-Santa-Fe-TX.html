<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you anticipate it to. The cooling and heating will mishandle and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Checking and altering the air filters is one of the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Residents of homes with bad indoor air quality may complain of signs such as headache, eye inflammation, tiredness, dry throat, sinus blockage, queasiness, and lightheadedness. Detecting ill building syndrome is tough since many illnesses can trigger these symptoms. Exceptionally high levels of some contaminants, such as carbon monoxide, can trigger more severe illness, including death.<p>
