<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
