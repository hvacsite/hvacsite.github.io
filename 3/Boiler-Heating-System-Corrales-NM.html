<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
