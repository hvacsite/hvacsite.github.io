<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heating unit, you might try to find a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
