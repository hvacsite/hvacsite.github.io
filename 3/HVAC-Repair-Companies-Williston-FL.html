<p>As with many house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heater can vary widely based upon the size of the home. Most furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
