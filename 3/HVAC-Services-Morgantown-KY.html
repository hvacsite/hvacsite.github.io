And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
