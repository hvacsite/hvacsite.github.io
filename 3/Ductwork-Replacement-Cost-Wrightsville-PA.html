<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>A lot of credible HVAC technicians will provide free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who attempt to provide you a free quote over the phone, as it may not accurately show what they will find as soon as they take a look at the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost estimate, that amount will normally be applied towards your balance due, need to you decide to hire that contractor.<p>
<p>We have been using Keefe's for many years and have constantly been incredibly pleased. They offer excellent repair set up and the customer service is wonderful. We just recently had a problem with an older unit and contacted us to set up a day and time to have it examined. They sent James Bell and he was excellent. He took the time to explain our alternatives cost distinctions and was very experienced professional and valuable. Happy customers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
