<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans should be installed in all kitchens and bathrooms. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide. The most efficient fans are peaceful and resilient. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to ensure the fans run for an enough amount of time. A great general rule is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
