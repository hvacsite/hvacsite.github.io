<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
