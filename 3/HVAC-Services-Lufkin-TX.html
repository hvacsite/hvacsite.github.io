<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
