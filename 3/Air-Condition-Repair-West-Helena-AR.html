<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation.
