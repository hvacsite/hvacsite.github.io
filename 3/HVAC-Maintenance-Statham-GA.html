I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
