This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
