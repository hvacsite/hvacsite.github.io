Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Permeable products, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
