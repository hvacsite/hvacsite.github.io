<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Outside pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.
