<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
