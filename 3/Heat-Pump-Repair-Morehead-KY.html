<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Central Heat And Air Units in Morehead KY 40351</h3>
<p>Remember that the SEER rating is determined utilizing the exact same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The average summertime temperature level to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the correct SEER score for your area, subtract 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling units produced in the United States.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
