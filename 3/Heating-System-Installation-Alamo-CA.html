<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
