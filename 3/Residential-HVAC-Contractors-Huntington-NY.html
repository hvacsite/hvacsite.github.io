<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
