<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Sweeny TX</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
