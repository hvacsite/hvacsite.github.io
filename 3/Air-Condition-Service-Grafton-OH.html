<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
