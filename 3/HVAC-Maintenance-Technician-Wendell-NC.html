<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just adding refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and performance of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
