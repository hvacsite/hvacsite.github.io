<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
