<h3>Picking the Right HVAC System For Your Project in Brownsburg IN</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home building is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
