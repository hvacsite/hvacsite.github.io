<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service at Mundelein IL</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might set off attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some people can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
