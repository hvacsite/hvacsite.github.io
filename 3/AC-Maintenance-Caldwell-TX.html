<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
