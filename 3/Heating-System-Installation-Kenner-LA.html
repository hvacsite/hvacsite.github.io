<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter.

Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes damp.<p>
