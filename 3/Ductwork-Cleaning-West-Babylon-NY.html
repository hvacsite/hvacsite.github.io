<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
