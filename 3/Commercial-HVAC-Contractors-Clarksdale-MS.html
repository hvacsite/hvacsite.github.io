<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other short articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Don't worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply might need 24 volts of electrical power.
