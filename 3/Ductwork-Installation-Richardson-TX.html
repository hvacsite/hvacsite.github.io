<p>All homes need effective ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other workplaces is very important not only for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular illness have actually been linked to particular air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate symptoms but can result in cancer after many years.<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a number of special benefits over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.
