<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
