<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
