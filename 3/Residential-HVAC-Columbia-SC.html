<p>Information supplied in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures continuously evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to changes in each.

In fact, the dirt" we see might be developing as an outcome of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>

Follow the maker's instructions, specifically instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly adjusted.

While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
