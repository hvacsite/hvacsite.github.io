Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you may unknowingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes.
