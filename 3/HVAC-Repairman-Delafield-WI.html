This identifies the heat gain your house is subject to. The calculation is relatively easy to carry out and will expose what size system you require. If the one you're considering desires to identify the right system for your home entirely on experience, move on to another contractor.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
