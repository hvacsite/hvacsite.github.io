<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do recognize an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating system and choose to install it in your house, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses.

Speak With the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating unit where you live.<p>

To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outside air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
