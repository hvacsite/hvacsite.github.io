In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs but can result in cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
