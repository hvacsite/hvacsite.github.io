<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Big Rapids Michigan</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must also be checked regularly. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire threat. Disconnected fuel lines can compromise the efficiency of the HVAC system also. Soot can accumulate in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an effect on the system's effectiveness as well. The maintenance. service technicians will evaluate all of these elements of the furnace and thoroughly and eliminate all blockages and traces of soot.<p>
<p>In some cases an old a/c system needs to be replaced for cost, efficiency, or other factors. Nevertheless, picking an air conditioner is never a one-size-fits-all situation.
