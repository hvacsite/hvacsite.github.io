<h3>Tips for Fast Furnace Repair at Greendale WI</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
