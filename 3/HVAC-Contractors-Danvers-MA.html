<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
