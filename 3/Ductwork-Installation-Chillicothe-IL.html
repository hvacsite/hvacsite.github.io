<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. There are a number of design approaches in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>

A structure walk-through to check for odors and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings might be practical. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungi or bacteria and need to be gotten rid of, likewise.
