<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
