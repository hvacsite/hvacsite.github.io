<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
