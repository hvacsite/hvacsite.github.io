<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
