<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
