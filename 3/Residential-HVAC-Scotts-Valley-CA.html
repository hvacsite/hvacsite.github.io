When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this.
