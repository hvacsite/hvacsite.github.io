Another element of the job is recommending customers regarding how to prevent future issues and correctly keep devices by, for example, routinely oiling parts or changing filters. In short, the HVAC technician has 3 objectives: Avoid issues. Save money. Stay comfortable. These service technicians may also be associated with working together with sales and engineering departments to develop items that react to customer requirements and market opportunities.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
