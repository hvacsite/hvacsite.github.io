"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized.
