<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the concern and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for. They met my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
