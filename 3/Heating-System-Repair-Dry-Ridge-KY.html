<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Dry Ridge Kentucky</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the exact same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
