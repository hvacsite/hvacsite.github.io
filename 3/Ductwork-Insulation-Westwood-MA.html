<h3>What You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Westwood MA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
