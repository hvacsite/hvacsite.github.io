He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
