I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
