<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if essential, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
