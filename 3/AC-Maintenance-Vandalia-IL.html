<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
