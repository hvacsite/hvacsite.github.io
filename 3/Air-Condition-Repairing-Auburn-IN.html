<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978.

Bear in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
