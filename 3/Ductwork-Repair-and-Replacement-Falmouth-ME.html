<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Falmouth ME</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source units. The lack of moving parts means you're less likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
