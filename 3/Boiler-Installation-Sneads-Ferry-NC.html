<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Sneads Ferry NC 28460</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
