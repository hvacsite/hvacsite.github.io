<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
