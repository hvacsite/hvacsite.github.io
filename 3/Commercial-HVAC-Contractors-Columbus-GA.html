<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, since the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it considers not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
