<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other offices is necessary not only for workers' convenience however also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to signs like headaches, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
