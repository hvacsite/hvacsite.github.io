<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents.
