<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
