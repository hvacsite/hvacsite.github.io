<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the area. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heating unit needs to be. For currently built house heating systems, the contractor will require to remove the old furnace to include the new one. These charges will be included in the installation expenses.<p>
