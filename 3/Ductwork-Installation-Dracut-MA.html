<p>How climate change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>A split air conditioner consists of two primary parts - a compressor situated outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioners count on a set of pipelines to link the outside to the within air system which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split air conditioner installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to generate either heated or cold air.<p>
