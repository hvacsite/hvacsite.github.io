<p>Numerous house owners in Lancaster County are switching their home heating and Furnace systems from oil to gas, which usually shows a considerable cost savings.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>If your air conditioning system is old, consider purchasing an energy-efficient model. Search for the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units are about 15% more efficient than basic designs. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into impact on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency standards for central air conditioning conditioners for details, and think about purchasing a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>
