<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
