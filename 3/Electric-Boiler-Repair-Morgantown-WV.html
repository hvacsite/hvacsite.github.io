<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
