<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Additionally, property owners have a variety of choices to select from in powering a floor heating system. Glowing systems work with electrical, gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As numerous house owners are all too conscious, tradition furnace systems are typically restricted to running on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the market for that energy source turns unstable, rates can fluctuate, rates spike and you can wind up paying more to heat your home despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>

Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring displays.
