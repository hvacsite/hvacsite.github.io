The numerous surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we might see a window as altering somewhat with time as it ends up being unclean, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be evolving as a result of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
