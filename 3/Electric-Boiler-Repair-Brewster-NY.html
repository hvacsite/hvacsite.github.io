<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
