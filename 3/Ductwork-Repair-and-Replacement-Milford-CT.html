<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and knowledge to FIX the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
