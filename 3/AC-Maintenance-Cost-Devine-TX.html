<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
