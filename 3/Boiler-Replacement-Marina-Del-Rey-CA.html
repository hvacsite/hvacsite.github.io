<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
