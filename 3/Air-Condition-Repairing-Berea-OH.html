<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Berea Ohio</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's an easy issue like particles obstructing the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those elements may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing brand-new equipment.<p>
