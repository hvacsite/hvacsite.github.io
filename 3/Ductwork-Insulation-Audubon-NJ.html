<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air.<p>
