<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
