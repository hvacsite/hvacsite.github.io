<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
