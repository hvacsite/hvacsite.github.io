<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and harden-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
