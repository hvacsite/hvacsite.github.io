<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
