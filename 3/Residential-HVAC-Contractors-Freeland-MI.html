<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air distributing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they ought to be positioned. Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if individuals primarily stay seated in that specific location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
