Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
