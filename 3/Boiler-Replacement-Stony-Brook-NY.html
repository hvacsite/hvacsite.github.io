<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
