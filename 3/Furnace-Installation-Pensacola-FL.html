<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
