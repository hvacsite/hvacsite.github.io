EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air contamination among the top five ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Considering that pesticides can be discovered far from the site of their initial application, it is prudent to lower making use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside. Depending upon the site and bug to be managed, one or more of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be minimized or prevented by making certain that wooden structure materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood far from the house. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be significantly minimized.<p>
