Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
