<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
