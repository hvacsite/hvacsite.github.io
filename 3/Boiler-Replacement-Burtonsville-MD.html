<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
