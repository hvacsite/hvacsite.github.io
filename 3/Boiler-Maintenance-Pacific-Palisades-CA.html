<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
