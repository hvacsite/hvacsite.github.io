<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Garden City MI</h3>

There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the start. However then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous people.<p>
