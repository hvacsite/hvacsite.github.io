<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).
