<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home.

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold.
