<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>As a skilled HVAC professional, we suggest you have your systems inspected and regular maintenance carried out two times per year, once in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and when in the Fall (before heating season). It goes without stating the safety and convenience of your family or workplace personnel are necessary elements. Keeping what is probably the most pricey and important system in your home (cooling and heating) effectively kept will help keep your biggest investment of your life in excellent shape.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 1 month throughout which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a couple of years earlier, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have actually been a lot of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. When the heat gets unbearable, a central air conditioning system in your house implies you have the power to adjust the temperature to a constant temperature level.<p>
