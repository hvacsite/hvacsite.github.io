<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Also they detected the issue and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working, integrity Energy was fast to react. They appeared the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your brand-new under tile flooring heater too soon, prior to the mortar has cured, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere correctly, and might void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run prior to the substance had treated. And mortar manufacturers may decline service warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
