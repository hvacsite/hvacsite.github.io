<p>The primary health result related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
