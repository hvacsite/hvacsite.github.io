<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
