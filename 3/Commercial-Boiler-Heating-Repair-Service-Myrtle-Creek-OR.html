<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
