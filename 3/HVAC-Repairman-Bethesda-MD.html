<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks.
