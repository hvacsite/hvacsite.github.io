<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Elwood IN</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
