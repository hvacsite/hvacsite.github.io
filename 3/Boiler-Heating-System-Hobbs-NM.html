<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
