Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>

Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
