He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
