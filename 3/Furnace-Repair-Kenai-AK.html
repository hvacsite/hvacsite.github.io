In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
