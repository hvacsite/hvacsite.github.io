There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
