<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Mount Holly North Carolina</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
