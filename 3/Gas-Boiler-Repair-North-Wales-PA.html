<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
