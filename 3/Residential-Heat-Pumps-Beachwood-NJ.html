<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system producers usually make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
