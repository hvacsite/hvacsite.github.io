<p>It is particularly essential to take as many of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
