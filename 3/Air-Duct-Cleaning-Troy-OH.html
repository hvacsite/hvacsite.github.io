<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
