Extra weatherization measures ought to not be carried out up until these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the outcome of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow.
