<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
