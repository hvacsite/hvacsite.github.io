<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
