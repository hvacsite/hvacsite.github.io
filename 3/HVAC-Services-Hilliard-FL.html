<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We comprehend that all the options you now have for heater can be complicated, but our professional technicians deal with you so you understand how to operate the system to get the best and most effective air circulation. Airworks can help you find affordable, efficient heating units that can help to decrease energy intake and costs while keeping your house or company warm.
