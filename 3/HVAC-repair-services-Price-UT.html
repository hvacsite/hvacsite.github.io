<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation organisation totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
