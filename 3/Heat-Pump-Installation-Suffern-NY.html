Furnaces that kick on frequently might be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
