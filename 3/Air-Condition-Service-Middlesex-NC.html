Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).

The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
