Just recently I needed to call on these people two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a company model they take seriously.

Nevertheless, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners.
