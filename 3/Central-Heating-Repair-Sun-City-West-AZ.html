<p>Before you head out and purchase an air conditioning system, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your house properly. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house may not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To identify odors in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, people breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not hazardous, but might become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs might also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
