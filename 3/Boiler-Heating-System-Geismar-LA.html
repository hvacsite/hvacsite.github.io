<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
