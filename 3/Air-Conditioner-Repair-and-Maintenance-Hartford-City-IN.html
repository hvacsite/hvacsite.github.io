<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Hartford City IN 47348</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on unusual occasions.<p>
