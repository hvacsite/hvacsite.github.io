This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
