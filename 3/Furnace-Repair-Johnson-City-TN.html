<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
