This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.)
