<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Nanticoke PA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
