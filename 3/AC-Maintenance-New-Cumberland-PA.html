While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
