<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
