<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Heating System Installation in Southwick MA 01077</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health impacts pointed out. However, it is not always real that the effects noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too restricted to identify the levels at which the listed effects could take place.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that leaves into your home without being burnt. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
