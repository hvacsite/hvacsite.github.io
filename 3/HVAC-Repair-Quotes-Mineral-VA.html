<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
