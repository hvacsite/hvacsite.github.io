<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Hollywood MD 20636</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
