<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
