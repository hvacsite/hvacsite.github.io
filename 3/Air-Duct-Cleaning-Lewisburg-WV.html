<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Lewisburg WV</h3>
<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My partner stated that she had seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have satisfied in a long period of time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us.
