<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
