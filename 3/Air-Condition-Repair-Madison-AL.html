<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore in Madison AL</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners include a thermostat sensor, located behind the control board, which measures the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the ac system could cycle continuously or act unpredictably. The sensing unit must be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
