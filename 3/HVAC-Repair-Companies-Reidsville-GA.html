But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big seller who asked not to be called since he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to save money on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an acceptable variety that could avoid consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
