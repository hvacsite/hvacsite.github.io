<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
