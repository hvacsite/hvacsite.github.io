<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
