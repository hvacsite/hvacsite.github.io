<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
