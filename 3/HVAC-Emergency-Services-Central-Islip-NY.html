<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
