<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Cheshire CT</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was impressive. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the essential electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
