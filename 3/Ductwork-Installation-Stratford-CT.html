<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Stratford CT 06614</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have several control panel. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more.
