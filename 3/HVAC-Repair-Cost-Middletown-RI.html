<p>It is especially crucial to take as a number of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or participating in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also pick to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather authorizations.<p>
