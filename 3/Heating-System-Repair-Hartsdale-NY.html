<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
