<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and unclean. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working successfully, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
