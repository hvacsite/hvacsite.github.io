<p>I am an investor, I need to replace two heaters in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as constructing products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release toxins intermittently. Malfunctioning or unvented appliances or improperly utilized products can release higher and often dangerous levels of toxins inside your home.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
