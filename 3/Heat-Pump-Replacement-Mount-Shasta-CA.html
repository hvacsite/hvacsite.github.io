<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heaters can heat your home. Honestly, our home heating unit is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about potential effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's directions, specifically guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
