<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced.
