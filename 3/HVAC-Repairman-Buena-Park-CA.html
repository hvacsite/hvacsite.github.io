<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
