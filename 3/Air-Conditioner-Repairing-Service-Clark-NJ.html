<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary substantially from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might need totally different steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being inspected. Installations can also differ considerably, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In some cases, entirely new ductwork might require to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a construct or restoration job. For example, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be installed as a DIY task as it is easy to lay down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily connected to the mesh, all set to be rolled out in location. Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
