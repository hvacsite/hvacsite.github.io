<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
