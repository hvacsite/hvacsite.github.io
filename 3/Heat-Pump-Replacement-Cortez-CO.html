<p>. Prior to choosing the installation area of air conditioning system, a number of main elements require to be considered. Firstly, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there need to not be any barriers on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit needs to likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be successfully discharged outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop greatly.
