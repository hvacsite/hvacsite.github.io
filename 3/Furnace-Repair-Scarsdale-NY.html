<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
