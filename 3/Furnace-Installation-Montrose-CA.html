Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
