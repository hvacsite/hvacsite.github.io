<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.
