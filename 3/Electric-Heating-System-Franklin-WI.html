<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Franklin WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
