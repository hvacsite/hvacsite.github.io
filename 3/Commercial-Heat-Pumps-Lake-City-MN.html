Some results might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions common in the house.<p>

<p>We look at hints prior to we offer guidance to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively.

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
