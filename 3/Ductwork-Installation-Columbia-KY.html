From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance.

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
