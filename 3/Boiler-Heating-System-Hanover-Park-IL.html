<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Hanover Park IL HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Most people know that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can also have substantial, damaging impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination among the leading 5 environmental health risks to the general public.<p>
<p>Once you've got the ideal furnace selected and installed, you're going to need to keep it in good condition. Looking after your furnace does not just include repairing it when it breaks. You'll need to schedule preventive maintenance for it as well if you want your furnace to live a efficient and long life. Having an HVAC technician give your furnace a tune up makes it possible to recognize and remove possible issues before they grow large enough to adversely affect its performance. You must set up preventive maintenance for your furnace a minimum of once a year.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC in Hanover Park IL 60133</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
