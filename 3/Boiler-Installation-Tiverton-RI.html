<p>Immediate results might appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are treatable and normally short-term.

Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
