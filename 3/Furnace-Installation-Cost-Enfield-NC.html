<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Enfield NC</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
