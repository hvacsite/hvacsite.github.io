<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
