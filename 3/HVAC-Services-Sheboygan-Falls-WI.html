<p>To be sincere, few of the centers managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us for that reason. Usually they were at first thinking about from another location keeping track of some other element of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they discovered and carried out indoor air quality keeping an eye on to offer a healthier, much safer structure environment-- and to avoid the negative consequences related to indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
