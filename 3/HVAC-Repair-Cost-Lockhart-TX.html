The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance.
