<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
