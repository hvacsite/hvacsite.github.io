<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Pleasanton TX</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
