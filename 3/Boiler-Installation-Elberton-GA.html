<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Elberton GA 30635</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
